forget the present, and live only in the past.</p>

<h2><a name="THE_STORY_OF_EDWARD_LYON" id="THE_STORY_OF_EDWARD_LYON"></a>THE STORY OF EDWARD LYON;</h2>
<h3>OR,<br/>
CONFESSING A FAULT.</h3>


<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t like James Parker, and
I&rsquo;ll never play with him again as long as I
live,&rdquo; said a little boy, warmly, whose name
was Edward Lyon.</p>

<p>His father, hearing the words of his son, called
him, and said,</p>

<p>&ldquo;Edward, my son, what has happened to cause
you to speak so unkindly of your little playmate?
I thought you liked James very much.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;So I did, father; but I don&rsquo;t like
him now.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Why not?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Because he got angry with me to-day, and
struck me.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Struck you, my son!&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yes, indeed! he did so,&mdash;but I struck him
back for it!&rdquo;</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_11" id="Page_11">[Page&nbsp; 11]</a></span></p>

<p>When Edward&rsquo;s father heard this, he was
very much grieved. Taking his boy upon his knee,
he asked him to tell him all about his difficulty
with James Parker, and why James had struck him.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Why, you see, father,&rdquo; began Edward,
&ldquo;he was building a house with the blocks you
told us we might have from the building, and had
got it up very high, when I told him, in fun, that
I would knock it down, and threw a great stone at
it, just by way of make believe. Somehow or other,
the stone slipped in my hand, and struck his
house, and knocked it all to pieces. But I
didn&rsquo;t mean to do it. And then he came up to
me, with his face as red as blood, and struck me
with all his might.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;And then you struck him back again?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yes, sir.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;And then what did he do?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;He doubled up his fist, as if he was going
to hit me again.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;But didn&rsquo;t do it?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;No. He stopped a minute, and then began to
cry, and went off home.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Suppose he had struck you again&mdash;what would
you have done?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I should have hit him back.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Like a wicked boy, as you were,
then.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;But he was wicked, too, father.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Not so wicked as you, I think. In the first
place, it was wrong in you even to pretend that
you were going to knock his house down. Wrong

<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_12" id="Page_12">[Page&nbsp; 12]</a></span>

in two ways. First, you told an untruth in saying
that you meant to knock it down, when you did not
intend to do so. And then you took pleasure in
seeing him troubled, lest his house, the building
of which gratified him so much, should be wantonly
destroyed. Both the feeling and act here were
evil. And my son, in indulging the one and doing
the other, was not under good influences. And
then, can you wonder that James, after what you
had said, should have believed that you knocked
his house down on purpose? You said that you meant
to do it, and then did do it. What better evidence
could he have had of your unjustifiable trespass
upon his rights? Pleased with his house, its
destruction could only arouse within him feelings
of indignation against the one who had wantonly
thrown it down. Put yourself in his place, and
think whether you would not have felt as angry as
he did; perhaps much more so. Carried away by this
feeling, he struck you. This was wrong, but not
half so much as the fact of your returning the
blow. You knew that you had given him cause to
feel incensed at your conduct, and you ought to
have borne his blow as a just punishment for what
you had done. But, instead of this, you made the
matter ten times worse by striking him back. The
fact, that he did not return your blow, but
resisted the impulse he felt to strike you again,
shows that he is a much better boy than you are,
Edward; for you have declared, that if he

<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_13" id="Page_13">[Page&nbsp; 13]</a></span>

had struck you again, you would have returned the
blow, and have fought with him, I doubt not, until
the one or the other of you had been
beaten.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I am sorry I knocked his house down,&rdquo;
Edward said, as soon as his father ceased
speaking, and he hung his head and looked ashamed
and troubled. &ldquo;And I was sorry the moment I
saw that I had done it.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Then why did you not tell him so at
once?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I would, if he had given me time. But he
doubled up his fist and hit me before I could
speak.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Still, knowing that you had provoked him to
do so, you ought to have forgiven the blow.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;And so I would, if I had only had time to
think. But it came so suddenly&rdquo;&mdash;</p>

<p>&ldquo;You have had time to think since, my son,
and yet you have declared that you do not like
James, and never intend playing with him
again.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I didn&rsquo;t feel right when I said that,
father. I was angry at him. But I don&rsquo;t
suppose he will ever play with me again after what
has happened.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Why not?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Of course he is very angry with me.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;More angry with himself for having struck
you, I expect.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Oh, if I thought so, I would go at once and
ask him to forgive me for knocking his house down,
and for having struck him,&rdquo; Edward said, his
eyes filling with tears.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_14" id="Page_14">[Page&nbsp; 14]</a></span></p>

<p>&ldquo;That ought not to be your reason for
asking his forgiveness, Edward.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Why not, father?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;You should go to him and ask his
forgiveness because you are conscious of having
injured him. You ought not to think anything about
what he may think or feel, but go to him and
confess your wrong, simply because you have acted
wrong.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;But how do I know that he will take it
kindly?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;That you must not think of, my boy. Think
only of the fact you have injured James, and that
simple justice requires of you to repair that
injury in the best way you can. Surely, the least
you can now do is to go to him, and tell him that
you are sorry for what you have done.&rdquo;</p>

<p>For a time, pride and shame struggled in the
breast of Edward, but at length he made up his
mind to do as his father had proposed. He not only
saw clearly that he had been wrong, but he also
felt that he had been wrong. James Parker lived
only a little way from his father&rsquo;s house,
and thither he at length turned his steps, though
with reluctance, for he did not know how James
would receive him.</p>

<p>As he came into the yard of the house where
James&rsquo; father lived, he saw his little
playmate seated quietly in the door, with his face
turned away, so that he did not notice him, nor
seem to hear the sound of his footsteps, until he
was close

<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_15" id="Page_15">[Page&nbsp; 15]</a></span>

to him. Then he turned quickly, and
Edward saw that he had been weeping.</p>

<p>&ldquo;James,&rdquo; he said, holding out his
hand, &ldquo;I am sorry that I knocked your house
down&mdash;but I didn&rsquo;t mean to do it. And I am
more sorry still that I struck you.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;And I have been so sorry that I struck you,
that I have cried ever since,&rdquo; James said,
taking the offered hand of his young friend.
&ldquo;I might have known that you did not mean to
knock my house down when you threw the
stone,&mdash;that it was an accident. But I was so
angry that I didn&rsquo;t know what I was doing.
I&rsquo;m so glad you have come. I wanted to see
you so bad, and tell you how sorry I was; but was
afraid you would not forgive me for having struck
you.&rdquo;</p>

<p>From that day Edward and James were firmer friends
than ever. Each forgave the other heartily, and
each blamed himself to the full extent of his
error. And besides, each learned to guard against
the sudden impulse of angry feelings, that so
often sever friends, both young and old.</p>

<h2><a name="SELF-DENIAL" id="SELF-DENIAL"></a>SELF-DENIAL.</h2>


<p>There were two little boys, named James and
William. One day, as they were about starting for
school, their father gave them two or three
pennies a-piece, to spend for themselves. The
little boys were very much pleased at this, and
went off as merry as crickets.</p>

<p>&ldquo;What are you going to buy, William?&rdquo;
James asked, after they had walked on a little
way.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know,&rdquo; William replied.
&ldquo;I have not thought yet. What are you going
to buy with your pennies?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Why, I&rsquo;ll tell you what I believe
I&rsquo;ll do. You know ma&rsquo; is sick. Now, I
think I will buy her a nice orange. I am sure it
will taste good to her.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;You may, if you choose, James. But
I&rsquo;m going to buy some candy with my money.
Pa&rsquo; gave it to me to spend for myself. If
ma&rsquo; wants an orange, she can send for it.
You know she&rsquo;s got money, and Hannah gets
her everything she wants.&rdquo;</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_18" id="Page_18">[Page&nbsp; 18]</a></span></p>

<p>&ldquo;I know that,&rdquo; James said. &ldquo;But
then, it would make me feel so happy to see her
eating an orange that I bought for her with my own
money. She is always doing something for us, or
getting us some nice thing, and I should like to
let her see that I don&rsquo;t forget it.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;You can do as you please,&rdquo; was
William&rsquo;s reply to this. &ldquo;For my part,
I don&rsquo;t often get money to spend for myself.
And now I think of it, I don&rsquo;t believe
pa&rsquo; would like it if we were to take the
pennies he gave us for ourselves, and give them
away,&mdash;or, what is the same thing, give away what
we bought with them. Indeed, I&rsquo;m sure he
would not.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t think so, William,&rdquo;
urged James. &ldquo;I think it would please him
very much. You know that he often talks to us of
the evil of selfishness. Don&rsquo;t you remember
how pleased he was one day, when a poor
chimney-sweeper asked me for a piece of cake that
I was eating, and I gave him nearly the whole of
it? If that gave him pleasure, surely my denying
myself for the sake of ma&rsquo;, who is sick,
would please him a great deal more.&rdquo;</p>

<p>William did not reply to this, for he could not,
very well. Still, he wanted to spend his pennies
for his own gratification so badly, that he was
not at all influenced by what his brother said.</p>

<p>In a little while, the two little boys came to a
confectioner&rsquo;s shop, and both went into it
to spend their money.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_19" id="Page_19">[Page&nbsp; 19]</a></span></p>

<p>&ldquo;Well, my little man, what will you
have?&rdquo; asked the shop-keeper, looking at
William, as he came up to the counter.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Give me three pennies&rsquo; worth of cream
candy,&rdquo; William said.</p>

<p>The cream candy was weighed out, and then the man
asked James what he should get for him.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I want a nice sweet orange, for a
penny,&rdquo; said James.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Our best oranges are twopence,&rdquo; was
the reply.</p>

<p>&ldquo;But I have only a penny, and I want a nice
orange for my mother, who is sick.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Do you buy it with your own money, my
little man?&rdquo; asked the confectioner.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yes, sir,&rdquo; was the low answer.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Then take one of the best, for your penny,
and here is some candy into the bargain. I love to
see little boys thoughtful of their
mothers.&rdquo; And the man patted James upon the
head, and seemed much pleased.</p>

<p>William felt bad when he heard what the man said,
and began to think how very much pleased his
mother would be when James took her the orange
after school.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I wish I had bought an orange too,&rdquo;
he said, as he went along, eating his candy, which
did not taste half so good as he had expected it
would taste.</p>

<p>Do you know why it did not taste so good? I

<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_20" id="Page_20">[Page&nbsp; 20]</a></span>

will tell you. His mind was not at ease. When our
thoughts trouble us, we take little or no pleasure
in anything. To make this still plainer, I will
just mention the case of a boy, who thought it
would be so pleasant if he could play all the
time, instead of going to school. So much did he
think about this, that one morning, he resolved
that he would not go to school when sent, but
would go out into the woods, and play all day, and
be so happy.</p>

<p>So, when he started off, with his dinner in a
little basket, instead of going to the
school-room, he went to the woods.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Oh, this is so pleasant!&rdquo; he said, on
first arriving at the woods&mdash;&ldquo;No books nor
lessons&mdash;no sitting still all day. Oh, I shall be
so happy!&rdquo;</p>

<p>As he said this, the thought of his parents, and
of their grief and displeasure, if they should
find out that he had played truant, came into his
mind, and made him feel very unhappy. But he
endeavoured to forget this, and began to frisk
about, and to try his best to be delighted with
his new-found freedom. But it was of no use. His
thoughts would go back to his parents, and to a
consciousness of his disobedience; and these
thoughts destroyed all the pleasantness of being
freed from school. At last, he grew weary of
everything around him, and began to wish that he
was again at school. But he was afraid to go now,
it had become so late;

<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_21" id="Page_21">[Page&nbsp; 21]</a></span>

and so he had to stay in
the woods all day. It seemed to him the longest
day he had ever spent, for the thoughts of his
disobedience, and the fear of his parents&rsquo;
displeasure, if they were to find out what he had
done, prevented him from taking any enjoyment. Oh,
how glad he was, when the sun began to go down
towards the west! But it seemed to him that it
never would get to be five o&rsquo;clock. Every
man he saw with a watch he asked the time of day,
and every answer he received disappointed him, for
he was sure it must be later.</p>

<p>At last the time came for him to go home. As he
drew near, he began to tremble, lest his parents
should have made the discovery that he had not
been to school. They did not know it, however,
until the little boy, to ease his troubled mind,
confessed his fault.</p>

<p>Now this little boy could not enjoy himself in the
woods because his mind was not at ease. He was not
satisfied with himself. He could not approve of
his own conduct.</p>

<p>So it was with William. He felt that he had been
selfish, and that this selfishness would appear
when his brother carried home the orange for their
sick mother. It was for this reason that his candy
did not taste so good to him as he had expected
that it would. But James ate his with much
satisfaction.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_22" id="Page_22">[Page&nbsp; 22]</a></span></p>

<p>&ldquo;I wish I had bought ma&rsquo; an orange
with my pennies,&rdquo; William said, as they were
going home from school.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I wish you had, too,&rdquo; replied his
unselfish brother, &ldquo;for then we should have
two to give her, instead of one.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;See, ma&rsquo;, what a nice sweet orange I
have bought you,&rdquo; he said, as he arrived at
home, and went into his mother&rsquo;s sick
chamber.</p>

<p>&ldquo;It is, indeed, very nice, my son, and it
will taste good to me. I have wanted an orange all
the morning. Where did you get it?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Pa&rsquo; gave me a penny, this morning,
and I bought it with this. I thought you would
like to have one.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;You are very good, my son, to think of your
sick mother. And you wouldn&rsquo;t spend your
penny for cake or candy; but denied yourself, that
you might get an orange for me? Mother loves you
for this manifestation of your <i>self-denial</i> and
love for your parent.&rdquo; And she kissed him.</p>

<p>William heard all this, and it made him feel very
bad indeed. Oh, how he did wish that he had bought
something for his mother with the pennies his
father had given him! But it was too late now.</p>

<p>The pain he felt, however, was useful to him. It
taught him to know that we may often obtain far
greater happiness by denying ourselves for the

<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_23" id="Page_23">[Page&nbsp; 23]</a></span>

sake of others, than in seeking alone the
gratification of our own appetite; and he
seriously resolved he would <i>try</i> in future to do
better.</p>

<h2><a name="ANNA_AND_HER_KITTEN" id="ANNA_AND_HER_KITTEN"></a>ANNA AND HER KITTEN.</h2>


<p>Little Anna has a very pretty grey kitten; and she
loves the kitty very much; and the kitty loves
her. Sometimes when Anna is playing with her doll
and nine-pins, kitty puts out her paw and rolls
all the playthings about the room, but Anna does
not mind that; she knows the little pussy does it
all for play.</p>

<p>One day, when Anna was alone with the kitty, in
the parlour, she made scratches on the window; and
that was a very naughty trick. When her nurse came
into the room, she asked Anna, &ldquo;Who made
these scratches on the window?&rdquo; Little Anna
felt ashamed of the mischief she had done; and she
did not speak a word.</p>

<p>The kitten was asleep in the chair; and the nurse
said, &ldquo;I suppose this naughty puss did
it;&rdquo; and she took the kitten out of the
chair, and told her she must box her ears, for
scratching the window; but little Anna began to
cry; and she ran up to her nurse, saying,
&ldquo;Oh, don&rsquo;t whip

<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_27" id="Page_27">[Page&nbsp; 27]</a></span>

little kitty; she did not scratch the
window. I did it.&rdquo;</p>

<p>And so the nurse did not strike poor puss; and
Anna took the kitty in her arms, and smoothed her
soft grey fur, and made her very happy.
Anna&rsquo;s father and mother and her grandmother
loved their little girl very much, because she
told the <i>truth</i>, and was so kind to her good
little kitten.</p>

<h2><a name="FAITHFULNESS" id="FAITHFULNESS"></a>FAITHFULNESS;</h2>

<h3>OR, THE STORY OF THE BIRD&rsquo;S NEST.</h3>

<h4>TRANSLATED FROM THE GERMAN.</h4>


<p>One fine spring morning a poor boy sat under a
tree, watching a flock of sheep which were feeding
in a meadow, between a clear, dancing,
trout-brook, and an old oak wood.</p>

<p>He held a book in his hand, and was so much
engaged with it, that he scarcely looked up,
excepting that from time to time he cast a quick

<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_29" id="Page_29">[Page&nbsp; 29]</a></span>

glance toward the sheep, to make himself sure
they were all safe, and within bounds.</p>

<p>Once, as he looked up from his book, he saw
standing near him a boy, not much larger than
himself, dressed in the richest and most graceful
manner. It was the prince&mdash;the eldest son of the
king, and heir to the throne.</p>

<p>The shepherd-boy did not know him, but supposed
him to be the son of the forester, who often came
on business to the fine old hunting-tower, which
stood near by.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Good morning, Mr. Forester,&rdquo; said the
shepherd-boy, taking off his straw hat, which,
however, he instantly replaced; &ldquo;can I do
anything for you?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Tell me, are there any birds&rsquo; nests
in these woods?&rdquo; said the prince.</p>

<p>&ldquo;That is a droll question for a young forest
man,&rdquo; said the boy. &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t you
hear the birds singing all around? To be sure
there are birds&rsquo; nests enough here. Every
bird has its own nest.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Then, do you know where there is a pretty
one to be seen?&rdquo; said the prince.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Oh, yes; I know a wonderful fine
one,&rdquo; said the boy. &ldquo;It is the
prettiest nest I ever saw in my life. It is made
of yellow straw, and is as smooth and neat inside,
as if it had been turned in a lathe; and it is
covered all over the outside with fine curled
moss, so that you would hardly know there was a
nest there. And then, there are five

<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_30" id="Page_30">[Page&nbsp; 30]</a></span>

eggs in it. Oh, they are so pretty!
They are almost as blue as
the bright sky, which shines through those oak
leaves over head.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;That is fine!&rdquo; said the prince;
&ldquo;come, show me this same nest. I long to see
it.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;That I can easily believe,&rdquo; said the
boy, &ldquo;but I cannot show you the nest.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I do not wish you to do it for
nothing,&rdquo; said the prince, &ldquo;I will
reward you well for it.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;That may be,&rdquo; said the boy.
&ldquo;But I cannot show it to you.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The prince&rsquo;s tutor now stepped up to them.
He was a dignified, kind-looking man, in a plain
dark suit of clothes. The little shepherd had not
before observed him.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Be not disobliging, my lad,&rdquo; said he.
&ldquo;The young gentleman here has never seen a
bird&rsquo;s nest, although he has often read of
them, and he wishes very much to see one. Pray, do
him the kindness to lead him to the one you have
mentioned, and let him see it. He will not take it
away from you. He only wishes to look at it. He
will not even touch it.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The shepherd-boy stood up respectfully, but said,
&ldquo;I must stick to what I have said. I cannot
show the nest.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;That is very unfriendly,&rdquo; said the
tutor. &ldquo;It should give you great pleasure to
be able to do anything to oblige our beloved
prince Frederick.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Is this young gentleman the prince?&rdquo;
cried the

<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_31" id="Page_31">[Page&nbsp; 31]</a></span>

young shepherd, and again took off his
hat; but this time he did not put it on again.
&ldquo;I am very much pleased to see the prince,
but <i>that</i> bird&rsquo;s nest I cannot show any
one, no not even the king himself.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Such a stiff-necked, obstinate boy I never
saw in my life,&rdquo; said the prince, pettishly.
&ldquo;But we can easily find means to compel him
to do what we wish.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Leave it to me, if you please, my dear
prince,&rdquo; said the tutor; &ldquo;there must
be some cause for this strange conduct.&rdquo;
Then, turning to the boy, he said, &ldquo;Pray
tell us what is the reason you will not show us
that nest, and then we will go away and leave you
in peace. Your behaviour seems very rude and
strange; but if you have any good reason for it,
do let us know it.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Hum!&rdquo; said the boy; &ldquo;that I can
easily do. Michel tends goats there over the
mountains. He first showed me the nest, and I
promised him that I never would tell anybody where
it was.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;This is quite another thing,&rdquo; said
the tutor. He was much pleased with the honesty of
the boy; but wished to put it to further proof. He
took a piece of gold from his purse, and said&mdash;</p>

<p>&ldquo;See here! this piece of gold shall be
yours, if you will show us the way to the nest.
You need not tell Michel that you have done it,
and then he will know nothing about it.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Eh! thank you all the same,&rdquo; said the
boy.

<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_32" id="Page_32">[Page&nbsp; 32]</a></span>

&ldquo;Then I should be a false rogue, and
that will I not be. Michel might know it or not.
What would it help me, if the whole world knew
nothing about it, if God in heaven and myself knew
that I was a base, lying fellow? Fie!&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Perhaps you do not know how much this piece
of gold is worth,&rdquo; said the tutor. &ldquo;If
you should change it into coppers, you could not
put them all into your straw hat, even if you
should heap them up.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Is that true?&rdquo; said the boy, as he
looked anxiously at the piece of gold. &ldquo;Oh,
how glad my poor old father would be, if I could
earn so much!&rdquo; He looked thoughtful a
moment, and then cried out, &ldquo;No&mdash;take it
away!&rdquo; Then, lowering his voice, he said,
&ldquo;The gentleman must forgive. He makes me
think of the bad spirit in the wilderness, when he
said, &lsquo;all this will I give thee.&rsquo;
Short and good, I gave Michel my hand on it, that
I would not show the nest to any one. A promise is
a promise, and herewith fare well.&rdquo;</p>

<p>He turned, and would have gone away, but the
prince&rsquo;s huntsman, who stood near and
listened to what passed, came up, and clapped him
on the shoulder, said, in a deep bass voice,
&ldquo;Ill-mannered booby! is this the way you
treat the prince, who is to be our king? Do you
show more respect to the rude goat-herd over the
mountains, than to him? Show the bird&rsquo;s
nest, quick, or I will hew

<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_33" id="Page_33">[Page&nbsp; 33]</a></span>

a wing out of your body.&rdquo;
As he said this he drew his hanger.</p>

<p>The poor boy turned pale, and with a trembling
voice cried out, &ldquo;Oh, pardon! I pray for
pardon!&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Show the nest, booby,&rdquo; cried the
hunter, &ldquo;or I will hew!&rdquo;</p>

<p>The boy held both hands before him, and looked
with quivering eyes on the bright blade, but still
he cried, in an agitated voice, &ldquo;Oh, I
cannot! I must not! I dare not do it!&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Enough! enough!&rdquo; cried the tutor.
&ldquo;Put up your sword and step back, Mr.
Hunter. Be quiet, my brave boy. No harm shall be
done you. You have well resisted temptation. You
are a noble soul! Go, ask the permission of your
young friend, and then come and show us the nest.
You shall share the piece of gold between
you!&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Good! good!&rdquo; said the boy,
&ldquo;this evening I will have an answer for
you!&rdquo;</p>

<p>The prince and tutor went back to the castle, to
which they had come the day before, to enjoy the
season of spring.</p>

<p>&ldquo;The nobleness of that boy surprises
me,&rdquo; said the tutor, as they went along.
&ldquo;He is a jewel which cannot be too much
prized. He has in him the elements of a great
character. So we may often find, under the
thatched roof, truth and virtues which the palace
does not often present to view.&rdquo;</p>

<p>After they returned, the tutor inquired of the

<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_34" id="Page_34">[Page&nbsp; 34]</a></span>

steward if he knew anything about the shepherd-boy.</p>

<p>&ldquo;He is a fine boy,&rdquo; said the steward.
&ldquo;His name is George. His father is poor, but
is known all around for an honest, upright,
sensible man.&rdquo;</p>

<p>After the prince&rsquo;s studies were ended for
the day, he went to the window, and immediately
said, &ldquo;Aha, the little George is waiting for
us. He tends his small flock of sheep by the wood,
and often looks toward the castle.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Then we will go and hear what answer he
brings us,&rdquo; said the tutor.</p>

<p>They left the castle together and went to the
place where George tended his sheep.</p>

<p>When he saw them moving he ran to meet them, and
called out joyfully,&mdash;&ldquo;It is all right with
Michel; he called me a foolish boy, and scolded me
for not showing you the nest at first, but, it is
better that I should have asked his leave. I can
now show it to you with pleasure. Come with me,
quick, Mr. Prince.&rdquo;</p>

<p>George led the way, on the run, to the oak wood,
and the prince and tutor followed more slowly.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Do you see that yellow bird on the alder
twig, that sings so joyfully?&rdquo; said George
to the prince. &ldquo;That is the manikin! the
nest belongs to him. Now we must go softly.&rdquo;</p>

<p>In a part of the woods where the oak trees were
scattering, stood a thicket of white thorns, with
graceful, shining green leaves, thickly ornamented

<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_35" id="Page_35">[Page&nbsp; 35]</a></span>

with clusters of fragrant blossoms,
which glittered like snow in the rays of the
setting sun.</p>

<p>Little George pointed with his finger into the
thicket, and said, softly, to the prince,
&ldquo;There! peep in once, Mr. Prince! the lady
bird is sitting on her eggs.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The prince looked, and had the satisfaction of
seeing her on her nest. They stood quite still,
but the bird soon flew away, and the prince, with
the greatest pleasure, examined the neat, yellow
straw nest, and the smooth, blue eggs. The tutor
made many excellent remarks, and gave the prince
some information in the meantime.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Now come with us, and receive the money we
promised you,&rdquo; said the tutor to George.
&ldquo;But the gold piece will not be so good for
you as silver money.&rdquo;</p>

<p>He took out his purse and counted down on a stone,
before the astonished George, the worth of the
gold piece in bright new shillings.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Now divide fairly with Michel!&rdquo; said
the prince.</p>

<p>&ldquo;On honour!&rdquo; answered George; and
sprang, with the money, out of their sight.</p>

<p>The tutor afterwards inquired whether George had
divided the money equally with Michel, and found
he had not given him a piece too little. His own
part, he carried to his father, and had not kept a
penny to himself.</p>

<p>Prince Frederick went every day to the bird&rsquo;s

<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_36" id="Page_36">[Page&nbsp; 36]</a></span>

nest. At first, the birds were a
little afraid of him, but when they saw that he
did not disturb them, they lost their fear, and
went and came freely, before him.</p>

<p>The prince&rsquo;s delight was full when he saw
how the little birds crept from their shells. How
they all opened their yellow bills and piped loud,
when the parents brought their food. How the young
nestlings grew, were covered with soft down, and
then with feathers; and at length, one day, amid
the loud rejoicings of the parents, they ventured
their first flight to the nearest twig of the
thorn-tree, where the old birds fed them tenderly.</p>

<p>The prince and his tutor often met little George
as he tended his sheep, while they strayed,&mdash;now
here, now there. The tutor was much pleased to
observe that he always had his book with him, and
spent all his spare time in reading.</p>

<p>&ldquo;You know how to amuse yourself in the best
manner, George,&rdquo; said he to the boy.
&ldquo;I should be pleased to hear you read a
little from that book which you love so
well.&rdquo;</p>

<p>George read aloud, with great zeal, and although
he now and then miscalled a word, he did his best,
and the tutor was pleased.</p>

<p>&ldquo;That is very well,&rdquo; said he.
&ldquo;In what school did you learn to
read?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I have never been in any school,&rdquo;
said George, sadly. &ldquo;The school is too far
off, and my father had no money to pay for it.
Besides, I have not

<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_37" id="Page_37">[Page&nbsp; 37]</a></span>

any time to go to school. In
summer I tend the sheep, and in winter I spin at
home. But my good friend, Michel, can read very
well, and he has promised to tell me all he knows.
He taught me all the letters, and the lines of
spelling. This is the same book that Michel learnt
from. He gave it to me, and I have read it through
three times. To be sure, it is so worn out now,
that you cannot see all the words, and it is not
so easy to read as it was.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The next time the prince came to the woods, he
showed George a beautiful book, bound, in gilded
morocco.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I will lend you this book, George,&rdquo;
said the prince, &ldquo;and as soon as you can
read a whole page without one mistake, it shall be
yours.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Little George was much delighted, and took it with
the ends of his fingers, as carefully as if it had
been made of a spider-web, and could be as easily
torn.</p>

<p>The next time they met, George gave the book to
the prince, and said, &ldquo;I will try to read
any page that you may please to choose from the
first six leaves.&rdquo; The prince chose a page,
and George read it without making a mistake. So
the prince gave him the book for his own.</p>

<p>One morning the king came to the hunting castle on
horseback, with only one attendant. He wished to
see, by himself, what progress his son was making
in his studies. At dinner, the prince

<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_38" id="Page_38">[Page&nbsp; 38]</a></span>

gave him an account of the bird&rsquo;s nest,
and the noble conduct of the little shepherd.</p>

<p>&ldquo;In truth,&rdquo; said the tutor,
&ldquo;that boy is a precious jewel. He would make
a most valuable servant for our beloved prince;
and as God has endowed him with rare qualities, it
is much to be wished that he should be educated.
His father is too poor to do anything for him; but
with all his talents and nobleness of character,
it would be a pity, indeed, that he should be left
here, to make nothing but a poor shepherd like his
father.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The king arose from table, and called the tutor to
a recess of one of the windows, where they talked
long together. After it was ended, he sent to call
George to the castle.</p>

<p>Great was the surprise of the poor shepherd-boy,
when he was shewn into the rich saloon, and saw
the dignified man, who stood there, with a
glittering star on his breast. The tutor told him
who the stranger was, and George bowed himself
almost to the earth.</p>

<p>&ldquo;My good boy,&rdquo; said the king in a
friendly tone, &ldquo;I hear you take great
pleasure in reading your book. Should you like to
study?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Ah!&rdquo; said George, &ldquo;if nothing
was wanting but my liking it, I should be a
student to-day. But my father has no money. That
is what is wanting.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Then we will try whether we can make a
student of you,&rdquo; said the king. &ldquo;The
prince&rsquo;s tutor here has a friend, an
excellent country curate, who

<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_39" id="Page_39">[Page&nbsp; 39]</a></span>

takes well-disposed boys into his house to
educate. To this curate I will recommend you; and
will be answerable for the expenses of your
education. How does the plan please you?&rdquo;</p>

<p>The king expected that George would be very much
delighted, and seize his grace with both hands.
And, indeed, he began to smile at first, with much
seeming pleasure, but immediately after, a
troubled expression came over his face, and he
looked down in silence.</p>

<p>&ldquo;What is the matter?&rdquo; said the king;
&ldquo;you look more like crying than being
pleased with my offer, let us hear what it
is?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Ah! sir,&rdquo; said George, &ldquo;my
father is so poor what I earn in summer by tending
sheep, and in winter by spinning, is the most that
he has to live on. To be sure it is little, but he
cannot do without it.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;You are a good child,&rdquo; said the king,
very kindly. &ldquo;Your dutiful love for your
father is more precious than the finest pearl in
my casket. What your father loses by your changing
the shepherd&rsquo;s crook and spinning-wheel, for
the book and pen, I will make up with him. Will
that do?&rdquo;</p>

<p>George was almost out of his senses for joy. He
kissed the king&rsquo;s hand, and wet it with
tears of gratitude, then darted out to carry the
joyful news to his father. Soon, father and son
both returned, with their eyes full of tears, for
they could only express their thanks by weeping.
When

<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_40" id="Page_40">[Page&nbsp; 40]</a></span>

George&rsquo;s education was completed, the
king took him into his service, and after the
king&rsquo;s death, he became counsellor to the
prince&mdash;his successor.</p>

<p>His father&rsquo;s last days were easy and happy,
by the comforts which the integrity of the poor
shepherd-boy had procured him.</p>

<p>Michel, the firm friend, and first teacher of the
prince&rsquo;s favourite, was appointed to the
place of forester, and fulfilled all his duties
well and <i>faithfully</i>.</p>

<h2><a name="THE_GREAT_MAN" id="THE_GREAT_MAN"></a>THE GREAT MAN.</h2>

<h3>WRITTEN FOR VERY YOUNG READERS.</h3>


<p>I will tell you a tale of a great man who loved
<i>justice</i>.</p>

<p>He had two sons whom he also loved.</p>

<p>Now, he had himself made a law, that whoever
sought to harm the peace of the country where he
lived, should die.</p>

<p>There was a sad cabal against the peace of the
country soon after the law was made:</p>

<p>And the great man&rsquo;s two dear sons were at
the head of this wicked party. Their names were in
the list of bad men.</p>

<p>This great man loved justice more than he loved
his two sons.</p>

<p>He, therefore, made firm his heart, and sat upon
his rich throne, and gave the word that his two
sons should be brought before him;</p>

<p>And he passed sentence on them, as he would have
done on strangers:</p>

<p>For, he thought, why should they not suffer for
their faults?</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_42" id="Page_42">[Page&nbsp; 42]</a></span></p>

<p>We punish the poor and ignorant for their crimes:</p>

<p>So, it is just that we should punish the rich and
those who know better, too.</p>

<p>And this great man gave orders that his sons
should be beaten with rods; and that then their
heads should be cut off.</p>

<p>And there he sat upon his seat, as judge,&mdash;pale
and cold, but firm and brave.</p>

<p>And when all was past&mdash;when both his sons were
dead, and their warm blood lay shed on the ground
before him:</p>

<p>Then, when the <i>judge</i> had done his <i>duty</i>, but
not before, he gave way to the love of the father.</p>

<p>He arose and left his seat;</p>

<p>He went to his own house, and there wept and
mourned many days.</p>

<p>The name of this great man was Brutus.</p>

<p>Think upon his name, but think more of the true
love of <i>justice</i> and judgment.</p>

<p>This little tale is a fact that happened at Rome.</p>

<p>You have heard of Rome, I dare say; and you will
know more of it as you grow up.</p>

<h2><a name="PHILOSOPHY_AT_HOME_1" id="PHILOSOPHY_AT_HOME_1"></a>PHILOSOPHY AT HOME.</h2>

<h3>THE AIR THERMOMETER.</h3>


<p>It is a very good amusement for ingenious boys at
home, in the long winter evenings, to construct
such philosophical instruments, or perform such
experiments, as are practicable, with such
materials and means as are within their reach. It
is true, that this may sometimes make parents or
an older sister some trouble, but with proper care
on the part of the young philosophers, this
trouble will not be great, and parents will
generally be willing to submit to it for the sake
of having their children engaged in an
entertaining and instructive employment. We shall,
therefore, give our readers such lessons in
practical philosophy, as we suppose may be of use.
In this article we will show them how they may,
with few materials and ordinary ingenuity,
construct an <i>Air thermometer</i>.</p>

<p>The materials which will be wanted are these:&mdash;a

<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_44" id="Page_44">[Page&nbsp; 44]</a></span>

glass phial,&mdash;one that is broad at the base in
proportion to its height, so as to stand firm, is
desirable,&mdash;a glass tube of small bore, six or
eight inches long,&mdash;a cork to fit the mouth of the
phial,&mdash;a little sealing-wax, a lamp, and a small
pitcher of water. The work may be safely done upon
the parlour-table, provided that the materials are
all placed upon a large tea-tray, with an old
newspaper, or a sheet of wrapping-paper spread
over it. The paper will then intercept any drops
of hot sealing-wax which may chance to fall, and
which might otherwise injure the tray, and the
tray itself will receive whatever may be spilt.</p>

<p>The only article of the above materials in regard
to which the reader will have any difficulty, is
the tube. Such a tube, however, can usually be
procured at an apothecary&rsquo;s, at a very
trifling expense. One about the dimensions of a
pipe-stem will be best. In constructing the
instrument, this tube is to be passed down through
the cord, which is to be placed in the neck of the
phial, the lower end to go below the surface of a
little water, which is to be put in the bottom of
the phial.</p>

<p>The appearance of the instrument, when completed
and fitted with a scale, as will be explained
hereafter, is represented in the annexed wood-cut.
In constructing the instrument, the operations, or
the <i>manipulations</i>, as the philosophers call
them, are,</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_45" id="Page_45">[Page&nbsp; 45]</a></span></p>

<p>First, to bore a hole through the cork, to
receive the tube.</p>

<p>Second, to cement the tube into the cork.</p>

<p>Third, to cement the cork into the phial.</p>

<div class="figleft">
<a href="images/i045.jpg">
<img src="images/i045_t.jpg" alt="Diagram of air thermometor" title="Diagram of air thermometor" />
</a>
</div>

<p>1. The first thing is to bore a hole through the
cork, and this must be just large enough to admit
the glass tube.&mdash;After turning in the gimlet a
little way, it should be drawn out straight, by
which means the chips will be drawn out, and then
it should be put in again. For a gimlet will not
clear its own way in cork, as it will in wood. By
drawing it out, however, in the manner above
described, taking care to operate gently, so as
not to split the cork, and to guide the gimlet
straight through the centre of the cork, the hole
may be bored without much difficulty. If the hole
is not quite large enough, it may be widened by a
penknife which has a narrow blade, or it may be
burnt out to a proper size with a hot
knitting-needle, or a piece of iron wire. And thus
the hole is bored through the cork.</p>

<p>2. The next thing is to cement the tube to the
cork. In order to do this, the water is first to
be poured into the phial. About one quarter or one
fifth as much as the phial will contain, will be
sufficient. When this is done, the neck of the
phial inside should be wiped dry, for the cork is
to

<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_46" id="Page_46">[Page&nbsp; 46]</a></span>

be sealed into it, and unless the glass is
dry, the sealing-wax will not adhere. Then the
tube is to be passed through the cork, and the
cork put into its place, and the tube slipped down
until the lower end reaches below the surface of
the water, and nearly touches the bottom of the
phial. Observe, then, at what part of the tube the
cork comes, for this part is to be heated, and
covered with sealing-wax, in order to seal it into
the cork. It may be marked with a touch of ink
from a pen, at a point just above where it issues
from the cork. Then take out the cork with the
tube from the phial, and slip the cork along down
towards the lower end of the tube, so that you can
put the wax upon the glass.</p>

<p>In order to cover the part of the tube, which is
to pass through the cork, with sealing-wax, it
must be heated; for sealing-wax will not adhere to
glass, or any other smooth or hard substance, if
it is cold. To heat glass requires some care. It
must be heated gradually, and one part must not be
made very hot, while the adjoining parts remain
cold; for glass will not bear sudden changes of
temperature, or a great difference of temperature
in contiguous parts. Therefore, in heating the
glass, you must proceed gradually. Hold the part
over the flame of a lamp, but not so as to touch
the flame, and move it backward and forward, so as
to warm a portion of one or two inches in length,
equally. Then you can hold it more steadily, in
such a

<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_47" id="Page_47">[Page&nbsp; 47]</a></span>

manner as to heat the central portion. As
you do this, hold a stick of sealing-wax, so as to
touch the hottest part of the glass with it
occasionally, that is, the part immediately below
the ink mark. When the glass is hot enough to melt
the sealing-wax, the glass will coat itself with
the wax. After holding it a moment over the flame,
turning it round and round, so as to melt all
parts of the wax equally, the cork is to be
slipped back again over it into its place, where
it will become firmly fixed, as the work cools.
Thus the tube will be cemented into the cork.</p>

<p>3. Nothing now remains but to cement the cork into
the neck of the phial. The cork ought to be of
such a size, that it will go well down into the
neck of the phial, so as to have the top of it a
little below the upper part of the neck. For the
whole of the upper part of the cork ought to be
covered with sealing wax, in order to make it air
tight, and this can be best done if the glass
rises a little above the top of the cork. If
necessary, therefore, the upper part of the cork
must be carefully removed with a penknife, and
then, when it is properly fitted, the sides may be
covered with sealing wax, by heating the wax in
the lamp and rubbing it on all around. When it is
covered with a thin coat of wax, it should be held
over the lamp a moment, turning it round and
round, until it is melted in every part; and the
neck of the phial should be heated in the same
gradual and

<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_48" id="Page_48">[Page&nbsp; 48]</a></span>

cautious manner recommended in the
case of the tube. When both are of the proper
temperature, the cork must be pressed down into
its place. Before the wax cools, see that the
bottom of the tube does not quite touch the bottom
of the phial, and observe also that the tube
stands perpendicular. If it does not, it may be
gently pressed to one side or the other, as may be
required, and held so until the wax has cooled,
when it will retain its position. The top of the
cork must then be covered with sealing wax, and
the surface smoothed by holding it over a lamp
until its inequalities run together. Thus the cork
will be cemented into the phial, and the air
thermometer completed, with the exception of the
scale. And the following experiments can be
performed with it:&mdash;</p>

<p>Exp. 1. On examining the instrument, it will be
observed that there is a portion of air closely
confined in the upper part of the phial. It cannot
escape up the tube, for the water covers the lower
end of the tube. If now the instrument is put into
a warm place, so as to expand this body of air
within the phial, the force of the expansion will
press against the water, and cause a portion of it
to rise in the tube. When so much water has thus
ascended as is necessary to allow such a degree of
additional space within, as will enable the
expansive force of the air within exactly to
balance the pressure in the top of the tube from

<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_49" id="Page_49">[Page&nbsp; 49]</a></span>

without, the water will remain at rest. If now
the air is warmed still more, the expansion will
cause the water to rise still higher, until the
two forces are again in equilibrium.</p>

<p>Exp. 2. When the water has been forced into the
tube as high as it will rise under the greatest
heat to which it is safe to expose it, it may be
carried again into a cool place. The heat which
was in the air and the glass will now pass off,
and the air within will lose some of its expansive
force, and will evince a tendency to return to its
former dimensions. This will be shown by the
subsidence of the water in the tube. Thus by
carrying the instrument successively into warm and
cold places, the surface of the water in the tube
will be found to rise and fall, thus indicating,
by the level at which it stands, the temperature
of the air around it, at its several places of
exposure. A scale for this thermometer may be
formed of pasteboard, and fastened to the tube by
threads or slits in the pasteboard, or, in any
other convenient manner.</p>

<p>Exp. 3. When the instrument is cooled, the water
in the tube does not simply fall by its own
weight. It is forced down by the pressure of the
outward atmosphere. For although the expansive
force of the air within is diminished by the cold,
there is still force left, far more than
sufficient to counteract the weight of the water.
So that the water descends, not by its own weight,
but by

<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_50" id="Page_50">[Page&nbsp; 50]</a></span>

the pressure of the atmosphere without,
acting upon the surface of the water in the tube.
This may be proved in the following manner. Raise
the water in the tube as high as possible, by
placing the instrument before the fire, and then
stop the upper end of the tube with the thumb, or
a little hot sealing-wax. Now, if the thermometer
be taken to a cool place, it will be found that
the water will not fall. The pressure from above
in the tube being taken off the water is kept up
by the expansive force which still remains in the
air within. When the stopper is removed from the
tube, so as to allow the external atmosphere to
press upon the water again, it will immediately
subside.</p>

<p>Exp. 4. Whatever may have been the temperature of
the room where the thermometer was made, the water
in the tube will be, when at that temperature,
just level with the water in the phial; and of
course, when it begins to rise, it will be some
little time before it gets up above the neck of
the phial. Now as it can be seen better above the
neck of the phial than below, it is convenient to
have the instrument so adjusted, as to have the
surface of the water in the tube always kept
above. This can be effected by forcing a little
more air into the phial, thus increasing the
expansive force within. A few bubbles of air may
be blown in with the breath, by applying the mouth
to the top of the tube. This will add to the force
within, so that, even when the thermometer is
cold, the

<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_51" id="Page_51">[Page&nbsp; 51]</a></span>

water will stand in the tube above the
neck of the phial, and all the changes that take
place will be above that level, where they can be
easily seen.</p>

<p>Exp. 5. Place the mouth at the top of the tube,
and blow down into it as long and as hard as you
can. By this means you will force air in, until
the expansive force within is increased so much
that you cannot any longer overcome it. Then,
before taking the mouth away, stop the upper part
of the tube with the thumb. You will now have so
great a quantity of air within, that it will
probably have force enough to raise the water
higher than the top of the tube. If so, on taking
away the thumb the water will spout out at the
top, in a jet,&mdash;doing no harm, however, except to
sprinkle the spectators. After a few such
experiments, you will find that the water has
spouted itself all out, and you will be sadly
puzzled to know how to get more in without taking
out the cork. There is a very easy way, if you
only had philosophical knowledge enough to
discover it.</p>

<h3>A STORY FOR LITTLE READERS.</h3>


<p>&ldquo;Henry, dear, do come out to walk, this
beautiful afternoon. <i>I</i> am going, and do not want
to go alone; <i>please</i> come, won&rsquo;t
you?&rdquo;</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_53" id="Page_53">[Page&nbsp; 53]</a></span></p>

<p>&ldquo;Supposing I should say, No; I won&rsquo;t
go; what would you do, sister?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I should say, well, suit yourself, brother
Henry, and I&rsquo;ll try to go alone; but I <i>do</i>
wish you would go with me, it is so pleasant to
have <i>some</i> one, and I would rather have you than
any one else.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Well, you are a darling, good little girl,
and I <i>will</i> go with you.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Oh, thank you, thank you, dear
Henry,&rdquo; said Caroline; and they were soon in
the shady lane which extended from their
father&rsquo;s house to their uncle&rsquo;s, who
was their next neighbour.</p>

<p>Caroline and Henry wandered on, admiring the
beautiful things which surrounded them, and now
and then stopping to pick a flower. Often Caroline
would leave Henry, examining some plant, (for he
was quite a botanist,) and walk along without him.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Come, Henry; let us walk as far as the
brook, and then we&rsquo;ll go home.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Just wait till I see what this curious
flower is,&rdquo; said Henry. But Caroline did not
mind him, and continued walking slowly along, that
he might catch up with her, when he was ready.
Presently she stopped; her eyes sparkled, and she
almost screamed with delight; for, on the ground
before her, was a beautiful white rabbit. She held
her breath for fear of frightening it; but though
she drew nearer the dear little creature did not
seem disposed to run away; and she soon perceived
that it had hurt its

<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_54" id="Page_54">[Page&nbsp; 54]</a></span>

foot very much, so that it
<i>could</i> not walk. Caroline took the rabbit in her
arms, and as she was quite near the brook, she
thought she would give it some water; so she
stepped on the little bridge, but when there, she
found that she had no means of getting any, and
she called aloud:</p>

<p>&ldquo;Henry, come quick; I have found a rabbit
almost dead; come quick.&rdquo; Henry was soon at
her side. &ldquo;Let me see,&rdquo; said he; and
he bent forward to look at it. &ldquo;Poor little
thing, we will take you home and nurse you till
you are well again.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t you think, brother, that it
would drink some water?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;No, no; we had better take it home at once,
and <i>mother</i> will tell us what to do.&rdquo; And
the two children hastened home with all speed.
Their kind mother gave them directions for their
new-found pet, and in a week it was quite well,
and their parents gave them leave to keep it to
play with, after they had learned their lessons,
and as long as they were kind towards this curious
little creature.</p>

<h2><a name="THE_SLEIGH_RIDE" id="THE_SLEIGH_RIDE"></a>THE SLEIGH RIDE.</h2>

<p>&ldquo;Oh, I&rsquo;m afraid! I&rsquo;m
afraid!&rdquo; William Jones cried, shrinking
back, as his father took his hand, in the act of
leading him forward to lift him into a beautiful
sleigh, that had just drove up to the door, and in
which his mother and elder sister were already
seated; their feet comfortably wrapped up in a
warm buffalo robe.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Afraid! what are you afraid of?&rdquo; Mr.
Jones asked, in a tone of surprise.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Oh, I&rsquo;m afraid the horses will run
away&mdash;or that the sleigh will break. Indeed,
I&rsquo;d rather not go.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Do you not think that your mother, and
sister Ellen, and myself, will be in just the
danger you fear?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yes.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;And is not my son willing to share that
danger with those he loves?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;But why do you go, father, when there is
danger?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;We do not think that we shall be in any more

<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_56" id="Page_56">[Page&nbsp; 56]</a></span>

real danger, while riding with two gentle
horses, than we would be if we were sitting in the
house, or walking in the street. But come,
William; I cannot stand talking to you here; and
it is quite necessary that you try to overcome
your fears. So jump in, and take your place
alongside of sister Ellen.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;But, indeed, I would rather not go,
father,&rdquo; William urged, holding back.</p>

<p>Mr. Jones said no more, but took his boy up
gently, though firmly, and placed him beside his
sister. Then he got in himself,&mdash;took hold of the
reins,&mdash;spoke to his two fine horses, and at once
the whole party began to move off; the sleigh
bells jingling a merry tune.</p>

<p>Poor little William clung, frightened, to his
sister; and it was a good while before he could
get over the idea that the very next moment they
would all be thrown over and dashed to pieces.
After a while, however, he got used to the motion
of the sleigh, and seeing that they passed on so
smoothly, safely, and merrily, the idea of danger
gradually faded from his mind; and long before he
reached his uncle&rsquo;s house, he was enjoying
the ride as much as the rest.</p>

<p>William&rsquo;s cousins were all delighted to see
him, and he spent with them one of the happiest
days in his life.</p>

<p>And when the time came for Mr. Jones and his
family to return, William parted, with a feeling

<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_57" id="Page_57">[Page&nbsp; 57]</a></span>

of reluctance, from his happy playmates. As he
again stood by the sleigh, and looked at the two
stout horses that were harnessed to it, he felt
his old fear stealing over his mind. But he was
not only now ashamed of that fear, but felt that
to indulge in it was not right. So, with his best
effort, he restrained it&mdash;stepping resolutely into
the sleigh.</p>

<p>The last &ldquo;good-byes&rdquo; said, Mr. Jones
gave the word, and off they went. When about half
of the way home, and at a time when even the
lingering remains of William&rsquo;s timidity had
passed away, two wild young men, half intoxicated,
came dashing along in another sleigh, at a most
furious rate. Bent on mischief, and thoughtless of
the harm they might occasion, they appeared
determined to frighten the horses attached to
other sleighs, and thereby cause those who were in
them to be thrown out into the snow-banks.</p>

<p>It so happened that the sleigh in which were Mr.
Jones and his family, were passing near a steep
declivity, at the time these young men came up to
them, and ran their horses so close upon those of
Mr. Jones, that he was compelled either to be
rolled down the bank, or receive the shock of
their sleigh against his own. He chose the latter
alternative. As the two vehicles struck each
other, that of Mr. Jones was nearly thrown over,
and it so happened that Ellen, who was much
alarmed, lost her balance, and but for the

<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_58" id="Page_58">[Page&nbsp; 58]</a></span>

fact that William, himself dreadfully frightened,
seized hold of, and clung to her with all his
strength, she would have been thrown down a very
steep hill, and, perhaps, have been killed. As it
was, however, no one was injured.</p>

<p>&ldquo;If it hadn&rsquo;t been for me,&rdquo;
William said, while they were all talking over the
matter, on arriving at home, &ldquo;Ellen would
have been pitched head foremost down that steep
bank.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;But if you had staid at home,&rdquo; his
father remarked, &ldquo;it would not have been in
your power thus to have saved, perhaps, your
sister&rsquo;s life. And now, an&rsquo;t you glad,
my son, you were with us?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yes, father, I am very glad now.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Suppose, William,&rdquo; Mr. Jones asked,
in a serious tone, &ldquo;that in the effort to
save your sister, you had yourself been thrown out
of the sleigh, and badly hurt, would you then have
been sorry that you went with us?&rdquo;</p>

<p>William paused for some moments, with a thoughtful
countenance. He was weighing the fear of bodily
pain against his love for Ellen. At last he said,
with the moisture dimming his eyes,</p>

<p>&ldquo;No! I would not have been sorry,
father.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Why not, William?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Because, I would only have been badly hurt;
while, if I had not been along with her, sister
might have been killed.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Very true, my dear boy! And now, you remember

<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_59" id="Page_59">[Page&nbsp; 59]</a></span>

how often I have talked to you about
selfishness, and what an evil thing this
selfishness is?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yes, father.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Well, this feeling of timidity, which you
indulge so much, is a selfish feeling.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Selfish, father! How can that be?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Because there is nothing in it of
self-sacrifice for the happiness or comfort of
others.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I cannot understand you, father.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I do not know that it will be in my power
to make you understand me fully, William. But I
will try. You knew, this morning, that it would
give your father and mother pleasure to have you
with them, and also that your cousins would be
delighted to see you. But your idle fear, lest
some accident should happen, made you unwilling to
go. You would not risk anything for the sake of
others. If the great and good General Washington,
when called upon to take command of the American
army, had refused to do so, because there was
danger of his being killed; cannot you see that in
that feeling there would have been a strong
principle of selfishness?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Oh, yes. If he had done so, he would have
been very selfish. He would have thought more of
personal safety than the good of his
country.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Just so, William, will you think, when you
grow up to be a man, if you do not conquer this
timid feeling, which you now indulge. You must

<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_60" id="Page_60">[Page&nbsp; 60]</a></span>

learn, for the good of others, to risk personal
danger, and to be willing to bear pain of body as
well as mind, if called upon to suffer while doing
your duty to others. Of danger, it is not our
place to think, when fully satisfied we are doing
right; knowing that the Lord&rsquo;s providence is
over all, and that He will not suffer any harm to
befall us that is not really for our good. Learn,
also, this harder lesson,&mdash;a willingness to
encounter bodily pain, and even great danger, for
the good of others.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Llewellyn, son-in-law to King John, had in his
possession one of the finest greyhounds in
England. His name was Gelert. One day Llewellyn,
going out to hunt, called all his dogs together;
but his favourite greyhound was missing, and
nowhere to be found. He blew his horn as a signal
of the chase, and still Gelert came not. Llewellyn
was much disturbed at this, but at length pursued
the chase without him.</p>

<p>For want of Gelert, the sport was limited; and
getting tired, Llewellyn returned home at an early
hour, when the first object that presented itself
to him at his castle gate, was Gelert, who bounded
with his usual transport to meet his
master&mdash;having his lips besmeared with blood.
Llewellyn gazed with surprise at the strange
appearance of his dog. But on going into the
apartment where he had left his infant son asleep,
he found the bedclothes all

<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_62" id="Page_62">[Page&nbsp; 62]</a></span>

in confusion, the
cover rent, and stained with blood. He called on
his child, but no answer was made: from which he
concluded that the dog must have devoured him,
and, without waiting to reflect, or examine,
plunged his sword to the hilt in Gelert&rsquo;s
side. The noble dog fell at his feet, uttering a
dying yell which awoke the infant, who was
sleeping beneath a heap of mingled bedclothes;
while under the bed lay a great wolf, covered with
gore, which the faithful and gallant hound had
destroyed.</p>

<p>Llewellyn, smitten with sorrow and remorse for the
rash and frantic deed which had deprived him of so
faithful an animal, caused an elegant marble
monument, with an appropriate inscription, to be
erected over the spot where Gelert was buried, to
commemorate his fidelity and unhappy fate. The
place, to this day, is called Beth-Gelert, or
&ldquo;The grave of the greyhound.&rdquo;</p>

<h2><a name="THE_TRUANT" id="THE_TRUANT"></a>THE TRUANT.</h2>


<p>I received part of my education at a beautiful
town on the banks of the river Trent. It was here,
while a boy, that I first learned the danger of
disobedience. The precept had been instilled in my
mind a thousand times, and I knew it was the
command of heaven that we should respect and obey
our parents and teachers; but I had never felt
either the danger or the criminality of a
disregard of the Divine command till after the
following event.</p>

<p>It was December; and the river, on whose beautiful
banks the academy was situated, was frozen over,
so that people could travel, and sport upon it in
safety. It was a favourite diversion of the
students, most of whom were between ten and
fifteen years old, to play ball upon the ice, upon
skates; and many times nearly the whole school,
consisting of fifty youths, was collected in one
game on the glassy surface of the frozen stream.
We grew, at length, so fond of this recreation,
that we began to encroach upon the hours of study. The

<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_64" id="Page_64">[Page&nbsp; 64]</a></span>

bell rang unheeded, and when we came into
school, we were, as we deserved to be, reprimanded
by our good and indulgent preceptor; and many of
our number, ashamed of their behaviour, refused to
offend in like manner again. It was not so with us
all.</p>

<p>One day, a part of our number having staid out
upon the river more than a quarter of an hour
after the bell had done ringing, one of the boys
was sent for us; but we soon forgot that we had
been called, and continued our game. Shortly we
saw the preceptor, himself, coming down to the
river. We were then alarmed; and all, but myself
and Nathaniel Beecher, ran, by a round-about way,
to the shore and to school. <i>We</i> resolved to stay
the whole afternoon. The preceptor came out upon
the wharf, and called to us to come to him.
Fearing that we should be taken back to school and
punished, we resolved not to answer, and pretended
not to hear him. After repeatedly calling us, and
receiving no answer, he came upon the ice; but
when he had walked a short distance from the shore
we saw that we were in no danger of his catching
us, as the ice was very smooth. At length, in an
attempt to catch me, the preceptor slipped and
fell heavily upon the ice. I stood still, and
dared not go near, for fear he would punish me;
but I was now very sorry for what we had done. Our
preceptor had always been kind to us, and my
feelings were hurt to think I had been so
ungrateful.

<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_65" id="Page_65">[Page&nbsp; 65]</a></span>

Meantime he had got up, and with a
painful effort walked to the shore. I followed
him, and Nat went off towards the other side of
the river. As I approached the shore, I turned to
see where he was going, continuing to skate
backwards as I looked. Suddenly I found myself in
the water. I had fallen into a hole which had been
cut for fishing. As I dropped I threw out my arms,
and thus saved myself from going under; but the
current was very strong, and it was with the
utmost difficulty that I could hold myself above
the water. I felt as though some evil spirit
beneath the water was dragging me under, and my
heart sunk within me. At length I was drawn out of
the water by my preceptor. He spoke kindly to me,
and said he would take me home, that I might
change my clothes. I was very much affected. I had
prepared myself to bear my well-merited
punishment; but when I heard his kind and gentle
tones, and saw that he was not angry, I burst into
a passionate flood of tears, and, dropping on my
knees, begged his pardon for my bad behaviour. He
took me up at once, and told me never to kneel but
to the Lord, that he would forgive me. We had
nearly reached the shore, when I looked round for
Nat. He was looking towards us, and skating along
with his arms folded, and all at once dropped
beneath the ice and disappeared. He had, while
looking at us, skated into an air-hole. I
involuntarily screamed, and started with all speed
for the place.

<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_66" id="Page_66">[Page&nbsp; 66]</a></span>

The preceptor followed, having
guessed the cause of my exclamation.</p>

<p>The accident had been seen from the shore, and
many persons came hurrying to the spot, and among
them the father of the boy. He was told, on shore,
that it was his oldest son; and rushing to the
spot, and putting his head down in the hole, held
it there a long time, looking, but all was in
vain. The rapid tide had borne him far down the
river, and his body was never more seen.</p>

<p>The events of this day taught me the lesson of
<i>obedience</i>. It stamped upon my mind the truth,
that the first great duty, next to our devotion to
our Maker, is respect and obedience to those who
are placed in authority over us. I never again
<i>played truant</i>.</p>

<h2><a name="THE_HOTTENTOTS" id="THE_HOTTENTOTS"></a>THE HOTTENTOTS.</h2>


<p>At the southern part of Africa, a great many years
ago, there lived a simple race of uncivilized
people,&mdash;to whom the name of Hottentots has been
since given,&mdash;who supported themselves in their
rude way, and kept sheep and herds, whose milk
served them for food, and whose skins kept them
warm.</p>

<p>The Dutch people, who were very fond of sailing
about in their ships, came to this part of the
world, and finding the country pleasant, and a
great many delicious fruits in it, they resolved
to make a settlement, and have a town of their own
there.</p>

<p>The Hottentots did not like very much to have a
new kind of people settling down among them, and
as they had been used to fighting with wild
beasts, and were quite brave, they did all they
could to keep the people away.</p>

<div class="figcenter">
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_72" id="Page_72">[Page&nbsp; 72]</a></span>
<a href="images/i072.jpg">
<img src="images/i072_t.jpg" alt="Hottentot" title="Hottentot" />
</a>
</div>

<p>
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_73" id="Page_73">[Page&nbsp; 73]</a></span>But the Dutch had so much more skill and knowledge
than the poor Hottentots, that they soon got the
better of the savages, and the natives
were obliged to allow them to settle in their country.
The Europeans, when they heard of this pleasant,
warm country, came in great numbers, and each
emigrant was allowed to receive for his farm as
much land as an officer appointed for the purpose,
could walk across in an hour. They probably always
tried to get a tall man, who could take pretty
long steps. Whether they asked the poor
natives&rsquo; consent to this arrangement, the
history does not say; but at the end of a hundred
and fifty years, the Hottentots had been deprived
of all their land, and were compelled to work for
their invaders, except that some of the more
ferocious and bolder tribes retreated to the
deserts, and remain in a savage state to this day.</p>

<p>The colony afterwards fell into the hands of the
British, and about eighteen years ago, the
Hottentots of the Cape, about thirty thousand in
number, were made free, and allowed to have all
the privileges enjoyed by the white inhabitants.</p>

<p>Christian missionaries have visited this part of
the world, and many of the native inhabitants are
said to have been brought under the gentle
influence of Christianity. The Moravian
missionaries, some years ago, collected a number
of the Hottentots into a village, built a church,
and instructed them in many of the arts of
civilized life. They were taught several kinds of
manufactures, and

<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_74" id="Page_74">[Page&nbsp; 74]</a></span>

travellers speak of their establishment as being
in a very flourishing state.</p>

<p>In the year 1811, this place was visited by a
sever earthquake, which alarmed the people
greatly, as nothing of the kind had occurred since
the settlement of the town. It does not appear
from the accounts, that any lives were lost, but
many of the buildings were cracked, and in part
thrown down.</p>

<p>The Hottentots are said to be kind and gentle in
their natures, and hospitable to strangers. Those
who have been converted to Christianity, have left
off, for the most part, their rude sheepskin
dress, and wear a more civilized attire.</p>

<p>The picture at the beginning of this article
represents a native Hottentot, in his sheepskin
cloak, but the rest of his dress appears to be
after the European fashion. The more savage
Hottentots, who have never joined the colony, lead
a wandering life, living on wild roots, locusts,
and eggs, toads, lizards, mice, and such other
food as can be obtained in the deserts. They use,
as weapons of defence, the javelin, and bows and
arrows. Their arrows are small, but they are
tipped with poison, so that a wound from them is
generally fatal.</p>

<p>They teach their children early the use of the bow
and arrow; and some travellers say, that, to do
this, they sometimes put a little boy&rsquo;s
breakfast, probably a nice toad, or half a dozen
ant&rsquo;s eggs, or

<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_75" id="Page_75">[Page&nbsp; 75]</a></span>

some other of their
favourite kinds of food, up into the high branches
of a tree, and then make the boy shoot his arrows
at it, until he brings it down. This gives him a
good appetite, and teaches him early the use of
the bow and arrow.</p>

<h3>THE WHISPERING FIGURE.</h3>

<h4>ILLUSTRATING THE PROPAGATION OF SOUNDS.</h4>


<p>Sound is propagated through a confined channel of
air, as for instance, a long tube, very perfectly.
It is not uncommon in large establishments, where
it is necessary to pass many orders to and fro, to
have such tubes laid in the walls, so that words
can pass through them from room to room. The
experiment may be tried in a leaden pipe, laid
down for an aqueduct, before the water is
admitted, and it will be found that the slightest
whisper can be heard for a distance of half a mile
or more. This tendency of a confined channel of
air to increase the distinctness of the sound
passing through it, may be shewn by a tube formed
by rolling up a large sheet of paper and
whispering through it. If the tube is gradually
enlarged towards the outer end, it greatly
increases the loudness of the sound

<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_77" id="Page_77">[Page&nbsp; 77]</a></span>

transmited through it, as in the case of the horn, the
speaking trumpet, &amp;c.</p>

<p>When the sound of a voice passes in this manner
through a tube, the voice always appears to come
from the end of the tube where the sound issues,
and not from the end where the words are really
spoken. This has given rise to an ingenious
contrivance called the whispering figure, which is
sometimes fitted up in museums for the
entertainment of visitors. It is as follows:&mdash;</p>

<div class="figleft">
<a href="images/i077.jpg">
<img src="images/i077_t.jpg" alt="Diagram of a statue with a tube to make it sound like it is talking." title="Diagram of a statue with a tube to make it sound like it is talking." />
</a>
</div>

<p>A large dog or other image is placed upon a stand
at a little distance from the side of the room.
There is a tin tube within the figure, one end of
which is opposite the mouth, and the other passes
down through the floor, and thence along under the
floor, as represented by the dotted line in the
cut. After passing the partition, it is turned up,
and opens in a funnel-shaped extremity in the next
room. If now a person speaks or whispers at the
outer end of the tube, the persons who are in the
room with the figure will hear the sound coming
through its lips, as if the figure itself were
speaking. The tube being entirely concealed within
the dress of the figure, and under the floor, the
spectators, not suspecting such a communication
with the next room,

<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_78" id="Page_78">[Page&nbsp; 78]</a></span>

wonder by what contrivance an image can be made to speak.</p>

<p>This experiment is sometimes performed by children
in private, by placing a board across the tops of
two chairs, and covering it with cloth, so as to
represent a table. The tube comes up through this
board into the body of some image placed upon the
table, as a doll, a figure of a dog or cat, or a
grotesque effigy made by means of a mask. In this
case a person is concealed under the table to
whisper into the tube, in answer to such questions
as the spectators address to the figure. Of
course, all these arrangements are made before the
spectators are admitted to the room.</p>

<h2><a name="STORY_OF_THE_SEA" id="STORY_OF_THE_SEA"></a>STORY OF THE SEA.</h2>

<p>Captain Albert had recently returned from a long
and perilous whaling voyage, and was seated beside
a bright blazing fire at his own hearth. His wife
sat opposite, with her youngest child in her lap,
while the two sons, Edward and William, stood on
each side looking earnestly in his face, that they
might be quite sure their father had indeed
returned, and that they were not still deceived by
one of those pleasant dreams with which they had
been so often visited during his absence.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Oh, father,&rdquo; said Edward, &ldquo;the
next time you go, take me with you, do!&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Tell us a story of the sea, will you not,
father?&rdquo; said William, at the same time.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Very well, my son, I will try,&rdquo;
replied their father; &ldquo;and that will,
perhaps, change Edward&rsquo;s mind about going
with me the next time.</p>

<p>&ldquo;One day, in the great Southern ocean, we
had followed a fine whale farther south than we
had ever before been. The whale was enormously
large, and I saw in a moment that if we could

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_81" id="Page_81">[Page&nbsp; 81]</a></span>

take it there would be oil enough to fill our
casks, and enable us to return home. Its motions
were very rapid, and we followed it as swiftly as
we could, but, after all, it escaped. I believe
the creature swam under water till it was out of
the reach of my glass. While I was looking out to
try to get a sight of it again, I espied something
which appeared to be an island, to the south, but
while I was looking at it I was sure it moved. It
did move, and we soon came near enough to see what
it was distinctly. It proved to be an iceberg,
shooting up to a great height, like one of the
sharp-pointed Alps, and spreading out to a wide
extent, on all sides. At the same time, the whole
ocean, as far south as the eye could reach, was
covered with floating ice.</p>

<p>&ldquo;The situation was full of danger, but the
wind was in our favour, and I prepared to press
all sail, in hopes of escaping, when suddenly a
shower of hail and sleet rushed upon us with such
fury that some of the men were beaten down to the
deck, and all found it difficult to stand under
it. The sails, shrouds, and sheets, were all cased
in ice, stiffened, and almost as immoveable as if
they had been made of iron.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I now began to blame myself severely for
suffering the whale to tempt me so far into those
regions of ice and storms. I looked with bitter
regret toward those faithful sailors who had
trusted their lives to my care, and who were now
exposed

<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_82" id="Page_82">[Page&nbsp; 82]</a></span>

to unnecessary hardships and dangers by
my boyish rashness. The noble fellows never
uttered a word of complaint, but <i>their</i> generous
fortitude did not help to reconcile me to myself.
Full of anxiety, I took my glass to look out again
for the iceberg. While I was looking towards it, I
spied something among the cakes of ice, which
appeared like some small craft; but I could not
believe a vessel of that size could have reached a
latitude so far south. A vessel, it certainly
was&mdash;a small schooner, sailing among the cakes of
ice, as if it knew how to pick its way alone, for
I could not see a person moving on her deck. We
steered, as well as we could, directly towards
her. My ship was new and strong, and well
prepared, so that I did not much fear the loose
cakes of ice. When we were near enough, I hailed
the little craft, and thought I heard a distant
shout in reply. As we came nearer, I saw a young
man alone, and sitting upon the helm, apparently
managing it with the motions of his body, so as to
steer his little vessel safely through.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>&ldquo;We all stood looking for a moment at the
brave young man, with wonder and admiration; but
as soon as I ordered out a boat, the sailors
rushed to the side and began to work with a will,
although everything they touched was cased in ice,
and terrible to handle. Down went the boat, and
was manned in an instant. It was not long before
the young man was on board our

<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_83" id="Page_83">[Page&nbsp; 83]</a></span>

ship, but he would
not leave the schooner until he had seen a rope
rigged to tow her after us. The poor fellow was
almost dead with cold and hunger; he had not
tasted any food for more than twenty-four hours,
as he told us afterwards. He could hardly speak a
word, and as soon as he felt the warmth of the
stove, he fainted entirely away. We put him into a
hammock, and did all we could for him, and soon
had the pleasure of seeing him revive. After he
had taken some warm tea, he fell asleep, and slept
till I began to fear he would never awake again;
but Providence had provided him the refreshment he
needed, and when he awoke, the next day, he was
well and lively. I inquired how he came into so
strange a situation, when he told me that four
young men, without much consideration, had
purchased the vessel, and fitted her up for a
voyage of discovery into those far-off seas. They
had encountered a furious storm, which drove them
among the ice, near the place where they were
found. They had suffered very much with cold and
want of sleep, while the vessel was every moment
in danger of being crushed to pieces.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_84" id="Page_84">[Page&nbsp; 84]</a></span></p>

<p>&ldquo;In this distress his companions began to
drink spirits to warm them. They offered him some,
and urged him to drink, but he replied it would
make him worse, and reminded them of a ship which
was cast away one very severe winter, among the
rocks near his own native town, when all the
sailors who drank rum were frozen, while those who
did not drink, escaped. His companions, however,
would not listen to his advice, but continued to
drink, and were soon unable to move, and were all
frozen to death, and were still on the deck,
covered with ice and sleet. Robert (this was the
young man&rsquo;s name,) was saved by not drinking
any of the rum, but by using it outwardly, pouring
it into his boots, and a part into his
bosom.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;But how did you escape that terrible
iceberg, and get out of that dreadful sea?&rdquo;
said Edward: &ldquo;were any of your men
frozen?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;No,&rdquo; replied Captain Albert;
&ldquo;we suffered very severely, but we did not
use any &lsquo;fire-water,&rsquo; and every sailor
who went out in the ship, returned in good health;
still, all that we were able to do would have been
no more than the fluttering of a leaf in a
whirlwind, without the help of Him, who, you will
remember, was once in &lsquo;a little ship when a
great storm arose,&rsquo; and who said,
&lsquo;Peace be still, and there was a great
calm.&rsquo;&rdquo;</p>

<h2><a name="THE_OLD_SLATE" id="THE_OLD_SLATE"></a>THE OLD SLATE.</h2>


<p>&ldquo;I have a great mind to break this stupid
old slate,&rdquo; said little Charlie Fidget, one
morning, as he sat over his first sum in
subtraction.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Why, what has the poor slate done?&rdquo;
asked the pleasant voice of his sister Helen,
behind him.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Nothing; just what I complain of; it
won&rsquo;t do this plaguy sum for me; and here it
is almost school-time!&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;What a wicked slate, Charles!&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;So it is. I mean to fling it out of the
window and break it to pieces on the
stones.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Will that do your sum, Charlie?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;No; but if there were no slates in the
world, I should have no good-for-nothing sums to
do.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Oh, ho! that does not follow, by any means.
Did slates make the science of arithmetic? Would
people never have to count or calculate, if there
were no slates? You forget pens, lead pencils and
paper: you forget all about oral arithmetic,
Charlie.&rdquo;</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_86" id="Page_86">[Page&nbsp; 86]</a></span></p>

<p>&ldquo;Well, I don&rsquo;t love to cipher,
that&rsquo;s all I know.&rdquo;</p>

<div class="figcenter">
<a href="images/i086.jpg">
<img src="images/i086_t.jpg" alt="Woman in chair reading book to child who is standing beside her." title="Woman in chair reading book to child who is standing beside her." />
</a>
</div>

<p>&ldquo;And so, you hasty boy, you get angry with
the poor harmless slate, that is so convenient
when you make mistakes and want to rub them out
again. Now that is the way with a great many
thoughtless, quick-tempered people. They try to
find fault with somebody or something else, and
get into a passion, and perhaps do mischief, when
if they would but reflect a little, it is their
own dear selves who ought to bear the blame. Now,
Charlie, let me see what I can do for you.&rdquo;</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_87" id="Page_87">[Page&nbsp; 87]</a></span></p>

<p>So Helen sat down in her mother&rsquo;s great
easy-chair; she tried to look grave and dignified,
like an old lady, though she was but eighteen.
Charlie came rather unwillingly, laid the slate in
her lap, and began to play with the trimming on
her apron. &ldquo;Why, what is all this?&rdquo;
said she; &ldquo;soldiers, and cats, and dogs, and
houses with windows of all shapes and
sizes!&rdquo;</p>

<p>Charlie looked foolish. &ldquo;Oh, the sum is on
the other side,&rdquo; said he, turning it over.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Ah, silly boy,&rdquo; said Helen;
&ldquo;here you have been sitting half an hour
drawing pictures, instead of trying to do your
sum. And now, which do you think ought to be
broken, you or the slate?&rdquo; and she held it
up high, as if she meant to strike at him with it.</p>

<p>Charlie looked up, with his hands at his ears,
making believe he was frightened, but laughing all
the while, for he knew she was only playing with
him. Presently, however, she put on a serious
face, and said, &ldquo;Now, my little man, you
must go to work in good earnest to make up for
lost time.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Oh, Helen, it wants only twenty minutes to
nine; I can&rsquo;t possibly do this sum and get
to school by nine. I shall be late. What shall I
do? Miss Fletcher will certainly punish me if it
is not done. Can&rsquo;t you, just this once,
Helen?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;No,&rdquo; said Helen.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Oh, do, there&rsquo;s a dear, good sister;
just this once.&rdquo;</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_88" id="Page_88">[Page&nbsp; 88]</a></span></p>

<p>&ldquo;No, Charlie; there would be no kindness in
that. You would never learn arithmetic in that
way.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Just once,&rdquo; still pleaded Charlie.</p>

<p>&ldquo;No,&rdquo; answered Helen, in a kind, but
resolute tone: &ldquo;if I do it once, you will
find it harder to be refused to-morrow; you will
depend upon me, and sit playing and drawing
pictures, instead of ciphering. I will keep you
close at it till you perform your task.&rdquo;</p>

<p>So she passed her hand gently round him, and
though Charlie pouted at first, and could hardly
see through his tears, she questioned him about
his rule, and then began to show him the proper
way to do his sum, yet letting him work it out
himself, in such a pleasant manner, that he was
soon ashamed of being sullen. First she held the
pencil herself, and put down the figures as he
told her to do; and then she made him copy the
whole, nicely, on another part of the slate, and
rub out her figures.</p>

<p>After all this was finished patiently and
diligently, Charlie was surprised to find he
should still be in good time for school.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_89" id="Page_89">[Page&nbsp; 89]</a></span></p>

<p>&ldquo;Now, to-morrow, Charlie,&rdquo; said
Helen, &ldquo;don&rsquo;t waste a moment, but go
to your lesson at once, whatever it is, and you
will find it a great saving, not only of time, but
of temper. You won&rsquo;t get into a passion with
this clever old slate of mine. It went to school
with me when I was a little girl, and I should
have been sorry if you had broken it for not doing
your work. Generally, Charlie, when you see a
person fidgety and angry, and complaining of
things and people, you may be sure he has either
done something he ought not to do, or left undone
something he ought to do.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Away ran Charlie to school, thinking to himself,
&ldquo;Well, I suppose I was wrong both ways. I
ought not to have been drawing soldiers, and I
ought to have been ciphering.&rdquo;</p>

<h2><a name="LIZZY_A_FAIRY_TALE" id="LIZZY_A_FAIRY_TALE"></a>LIZZY; A FAIRY TALE.</h2>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_92" id="Page_92">[Page&nbsp; 92]</a></span></p>

<p>Lizzy was walking in a wood one day, and as she
stooped under a tree to gather some flowers that
grew at its foot, she heard a loud tapping high up
in the tree; she looked up, and there she saw,
clinging to a dead bough that industrious and
happy bird, the woodpecker. &ldquo;Are you going
to dig out a chamber for yourself there?&rdquo;
asked Lizzy. &ldquo;That bough is too small, I
should think.&rdquo;</p>

<div class="figcenter">
<a href="images/i092.jpg">
<img src="images/i092_t.jpg" alt="A woodpecker." title="A woodpecker." />
</a>
</div>

<p>&ldquo;Oh! I am not doing carpentry work
now,&rdquo; said the bird; &ldquo;there are some
nice little insects under this bark,&mdash;sweet
things!&mdash;which I love as well as you love the
lambs.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;And yet you intend to make a meal upon
them&mdash;barbarous bird!&rdquo;</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_93" id="Page_93">[Page&nbsp; 93]</a></span></p>

<p>&ldquo;Yes, as good a meal as you make upon the
lamb,&mdash;barbarous child! But let us forgive each
other; we must eat to live. You would love to eat
me if I were nicely cooked, and I should relish
you exceedingly if I could only change you into a
beetle-bug, or a grub of some sort.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Do not talk so, Mr. Carpenter: I would
rather go without my dinner than to have you
killed and cooked for me.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Ah! do you love me so well? Then I will
confide in you, and tell you a secret. My chamber
is in the trunk of this tree, and my six eggs lie
on the floor of it. Jump up here, and I will show
it to you.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I could not jump twenty feet into the
air,&rdquo; said Lizzy.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Why! are you not twenty times longer than I
am?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Oh, more; and more than forty times
heavier?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Well, well, I will go down and help you
up.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I should like to know how you expect to
help me,&rdquo; said Lizzy.</p>

<p>&ldquo;We shall see;&rdquo; and the woodpecker
flew down;&mdash;but where is he? Lizzy looked about,
and she could not see him anywhere.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Ha! ha! ha!&rdquo; laughed a voice close by
her ear; and Lizzy turned, and saw a pretty little
fairy figure standing close beside her. &ldquo;I
was only acting the woodpecker for my amusement.
We fairies are very fond of masquerading.&rdquo;</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_94" id="Page_94">[Page&nbsp; 94]</a></span></p>

<p>&ldquo;Then I cannot see the woodpecker&rsquo;s
nest,&rdquo; said Lizzy. &ldquo;It is too bad to
disappoint me so, when I did so want to see his
pretty eggs.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Oh, if you wish to see some pretty eggs. I
can show you some as pretty as the
woodpecker&rsquo;s. I have hundreds of them stowed
away in a woodpecker&rsquo;s hole, up in this very
tree. I had come here this morning to deposit
some, and this is what made me think of acting the
woodpecker just now.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Where did you get so many eggs? Do you rob
birds&rsquo; nests?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Oh, no, indeed! they are not birds&rsquo;
eggs; they come down in the rain, and we use the
large flower-cups to catch them in.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;And what will hatch from them?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Ah, that is more than I can tell as yet. I
will give you some of them, and they will hatch
just such kind of creatures as you tell them
to.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;That is a very likely story,&mdash;but give me
some, do; and I will tell them to hatch most
beautiful birds and butterflies.&rdquo;</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_95" id="Page_95">[Page&nbsp; 95]</a></span></p>

<p>&ldquo;Stay; let me explain a little, before you
count your unhatched birds and butterflies. I will
tell you how to hatch them. Put them in your
bosom, and they will be hatched by its warmth; but
what is hatched from them must depend entirely
upon what kind of feeling shall warm your bosom,
and upon what deeds you do. If you have a wicked
feeling, an ugly creature will begin to form
within one of the eggs; and if you let that
feeling cause you to do anything wrong, then the
egg will hatch. Are you willing to take the risk
of having spiders and scorpions in your bosom, for
the sake of the hope that they may be pretty birds
and butterflies?&rdquo;</p>


<div class="figcenter">
<a href="images/i095.jpg">
<img src="images/i095_t.jpg" alt="A moth." title="A moth." />
</a>
</div>

<p>&ldquo;Oh, yes!&rdquo; said Lizzy; &ldquo;I do not
think I ever have such bad feelings as spiders and
scorpions are made of.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Come, then,&rdquo; cried the fairy; and she
led Lizzy round to the other side of the tree,
where she saw, high up in the trunk, a
woodpecker&rsquo;s hole.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Run up,&rdquo; cried the fairy.</p>

<p>&ldquo;How can I? There is nothing but an ivy-vine
to cling to.&rdquo;</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_96" id="Page_96">[Page&nbsp; 96]</a></span></p>

<p>&ldquo;You mistake,&rdquo; said the fairy; and
she touched the ivy-vine with her wand, and there
was a nice rope-ladder leading up to the
woodpecker&rsquo;s hole. It was almost full of
small, pearly white eggs.&mdash;&ldquo;Take out three
or four,&rdquo; said the fairy, &ldquo;and put
them in your bosom, and before you reach home,
they will very likely all be hatched.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Oh, what pretty little things!&rdquo; cried
Lizzy, as she took them out; &ldquo;they shall
certainly hatch something pretty.&rdquo;</p>

<p>She was going to put them all in her bosom at
once; but the fairy told her she had better put
only one in at a time, and the others in one of
the pockets of her apron; for it would be rather
worse if there should be several spiders running
about in her bosom, than only one.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Oh, there will not be any,&rdquo; said
Lizzy; &ldquo;there will be a pretty bird hopping
about there&mdash;but I will do as you advise.&rdquo;
She ran down the ladder, and the fairy tripped
along after her, and when Lizzy turned to bid her
good morning, she saw the ivy-vine clasping the
tree, and the woodpecker tapping away at the bark.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_97" id="Page_97">[Page&nbsp; 97]</a></span></p>

<p>Lizzy ran along through the wood, hoping that
something would happen to arouse in her breast a
good affection of some sort,&mdash;for there was
nothing there now but a mingled feeling of
pleasure and dread,&mdash;for a sweet-brier bush, for
what purpose is not known, caught hold of her
dress, and thus occasioned a frightful rent; and
sweet-brier bushes, if they do bear sweet roses,
do also love to play off their jokes upon people,
in quite as unbenevolent a way as the blackberry
and thorn. But Lizzy thought it no joke at all.
What barbarous cruelty to tear her dress so, and
then to hold upon it so relentlessly! and whilst
she was trying to force the thorns to let go their
hold, she became so angry that she cried out,
&ldquo;Oh! I wish there was not a sweet-brier bush
in the world, I do! and I wish this was dead and
burnt up.&rdquo; But before she had released
herself from the bush, she felt something moving
in her bosom. Putting her hand in, she pulled out
an empty egg-shell, while the wasp, which had just
been hatched, flew around her face. She brushed it
away with her handkerchief. She looked at the
sweet-brier roses,&mdash;those little rosy cups all
arranged so garland-like on the bending
boughs,&mdash;and said, &ldquo;I wonder it was not a
scorpion. Poor little roses! I do not wish you to
wither; I want you to flourish, and breathe out
your sweet breath;&rdquo; and she bent her head
over them, and while they breathed forth their
sweet breath, they looked so much like little
infants, that the tears came into Lizzy&rsquo;s
eyes, while she said, &ldquo;May the Lord that
made you, forgive me!&rdquo;&mdash;When she lifted up
her head, she saw a wasp fall to the ground, and
then a pretty bird came, and picked it up and
swallowed it. Lizzy then took another egg from her
pocket, placed it in her bosom, and walked on,
taking care to keep at a safe distance from
sweet-briers and brambles.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_98" id="Page_98">[Page&nbsp; 98]</a></span></p>

<p>She had not gone far when she saw a little
sparrow fly from a low shrub, making a sound as if
he had a nest there. When he had gone so far away
that she thought he would not see her, she peeped
in amongst the leaves, and there she espied the
little home, with its three inmates; not three
little birds as yet&mdash;but, what she knew were quite
as dear to the parents, two speckled eggs.
&ldquo;Ah!&rdquo; thought Lizzy, &ldquo;how I
should like to see if I could not hatch a
sparrow&rsquo;s egg. I should be sure that a wasp
would not come out of a sparrow&rsquo;s
egg.&rdquo; And she put her hand very slily into
the nest, and stole away one of the
sparrow&rsquo;s speckled treasures, and laid it in
her bosom by the side of the fairy egg. As she
left the bush, she turned to see if the sparrow
went to look at it; and while she stood watching
him, she felt a strange nestling and fumbling in
her bosom, that she thought both eggs must have
hatched. Looking in, she saw a small snake
writhing about most energetically. &ldquo;I will
put the sparrow&rsquo;s egg back,&rdquo; thought
she, for she was struck with horror.</p>

<div class="figcenter">
<a href="images/i099.jpg">
<img src="images/i099_t.jpg" alt="A snake." title="A snake." />
</a>
</div>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_99" id="Page_99">[Page&nbsp; 99]</a></span></p>

<p>Throwing the snake upon the ground, in an agony
of disgust, she felt for the sparrow&rsquo;s egg;
but, alas! the empty shell was alone there,&mdash;the
snake had sucked the egg. &ldquo;How I wish I had
not stolen away the sparrow&rsquo;s egg! The snake
has eaten what would have been a pretty bird. I
would give the sparrow one of my fairy eggs, if I
thought he would like it, but perhaps he would
not. Vile snake!&rdquo; she cried, stepping back
as she saw the snake writhing on the ground close
by her feet. Her words seemed to give him a
death-stroke; he lay still, as though lifeless;
she touched him with her foot, but he did not
move. There was a little frog-pond near by, and to
make sure that he should not come to life again,
Lizzy took the snake on a stick, and threw it into
the pond and then put another egg into her bosom.
As she stood by the pond, lashing the water with
the stick, she began to fear she was not quite so
delightful a child

<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_100" id="Page_100">[Page&nbsp; 100]</a></span>

as she had imagined herself to
be, and to wonder what she should do to make the
egg hatch a pretty creature. &ldquo;Let me
think,&rdquo; said she, &ldquo;what have I to do
before dinner? I have some sewing to do, and two
lessons to study. Now, if I go directly home, and
do these things well, instead of staying here to
play, perhaps I shall find, after I have finished
my tasks, some bright bird, or shining insect, in
my bosom. To be sure, that ought not to be my only
reason for doing well, and it is not my only
reason.&rdquo; This was quite true; for Lizzy
began to feel so penitent for the unpleasant
things she had done, that she felt a desire to
make amends of some sort. &ldquo;I believe I
will,&rdquo; said she, &ldquo;go directly home,
and see how much I can do before dinner. Oh! see
the tadpoles! how they run and wag their tails,
queer creatures! but I must not stay.&rdquo; A
frog then leaped into the water, from amongst the
grass at the other side of the pond. &ldquo;Ah!
father long-legs! what a water-nymph you are! I
must just go round and see if there are not some
more frogs there; I do love so to see them leap
into the water with such a plash.&rdquo; And she
walked round the water, frightening the frogs from
the grass; and when they had all leaped into the
water, she thought she must sit down quite still
for a few moments, just to see if one would not
jump out again. She waited a few moments,&mdash;and
then a few more,&mdash;and then a few more. &ldquo;Oh,
dear!&rdquo; she cried, &ldquo;I will wait till

<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_101" id="Page_101">[Page&nbsp; 101]</a></span>

one&mdash;just one&mdash;comes, if I wait till night, I am
determined.&rdquo; But it seemed as if the frogs
were determined to be revenged upon Lizzy for
frightening them in, for not one lifted his head
above the water, for more than a quarter of an
hour; and Lizzy began to feel a little frightened,
and to wish she had made no promise. At length
one, more courageous or less obstinate than the
rest, leaped upon the bank. &ldquo;Oh; and there
is another!&rdquo; Now Lizzy must just go and
drive them in again, because it is still better to
see them leap in: for you then have the pleasure
of seeing them swim. As she stood watching them
swim, she thought the egg in her bosom felt cold;
this reminded her of her good resolution, and she
walked straight homewards.</p>

<p>It was dinner time when she reached home.&mdash;Ah!
where were the lessons and the sewing? and why had
not the egg hatched? It was a great while since
she put it into her bosom. She did not believe it
was going to hatch at all, for it still felt cold,
and she thought she would break the shell, and see
if there was anything in it. Yes, there was
something, and something very pretty, too. A
small, shining, green bee; but it was dead. Oh!
those amusing frogs!</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_102" id="Page_102">[Page&nbsp; 102]</a></span></p>

<p>&ldquo;Well, this one,&rdquo; said Lizzy, as she
put the last egg into her bosom, &ldquo;shall
hatch a beautiful bee; for, as soon as dinner is
over, I will sit down and be as industrious as a
bee on a summer&rsquo;s morning.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Lizzy,&rdquo; said her mother, while they
were sitting at table, &ldquo;what was that you
put into your bosom, just now?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;What, mother? when?&rdquo; asked Lizzy; for
she did not feel as if the story she had to tell
about the eggs would be one much to her credit,
and she was too proud to be willing to tell it.</p>

<p>&ldquo;As you were sitting down, I observed you
put something into your bosom; what was it?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Oh, I&mdash;just happened to put my hand into my
bosom.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Lizzy, you had something in your hand; I
saw it.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Why, mother, you are mistaken.
I&mdash;I&mdash;&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Tell me what it was, my child.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Why, mother, it was only my&mdash;my
thimble.&rdquo;</p>

<p>As the falsehood came out of Lizzy&rsquo;s mouth,
a black bat crept out of her bosom, and, spreading
out his filmy wings, fluttered about her
head.&mdash;Every one started up from the table; Lizzy
screamed, and tried to brush the impish-looking
creature away, but he persisted in fluttering
around her head. She ran from the room; but before
she could shut the door behind her, the bat was
out also, and sailed round and round her head. Her
mother followed her out, and tried to drive the
bat away, while she reproved Lizzy for putting
such ugly things in her bosom, and expressed very
great grief that her daughter should have told a
falsehood; and she told her that the falsehood
would

<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_103" id="Page_103">[Page&nbsp; 103]</a></span>

haunt and trouble her mind till she
confessed the truth, and begged forgiveness, just
as the black bat now troubled her by flying around
her head.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I will confess all,&rdquo; said Lizzy; and
she burst into tears, and throwing herself into
her mother&rsquo;s arms, told her morning&rsquo;s
adventures, without sparing herself at all.</p>

<p>The bat dropped down dead upon the floor.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Ah!&rdquo; said Lizzy&rsquo;s mother,
&ldquo;now, how good it is to confess and beg
forgiveness, and how pleasant it is to forgive.
See! he is dead, and I trust you will never more
put any such &lsquo;thimbles&rsquo; into your
bosom.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Oh, mother,&rdquo; said Lizzy, smiling, as
she dried her tears, &ldquo;I have no doubt it was
beginning to be a pretty little bee when I put it
in; but I will be one myself now;&rdquo; and she
took her sewing work, and sat down; and happening
to look up from her work to the spot where the bat
had fallen, she was delighted to see, instead of
the bat, a bee creeping along on the floor.
Presently he flew up, and crawled on her arm,
while she worked.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Well,&rdquo; said Lizzy, the next morning,
&ldquo;I really did not know I was so bad a girl.
Only think of my causing the existence of such
disagreeable creatures, when I thought I should
bring out such delightful ones. But I will do
better, certainly.&mdash;I wish I had some more of
these eggs.&rdquo; And she resolved to go again
into the wood, and seek out the fairy. She had
been strolling about for some

<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_104" id="Page_104">[Page&nbsp; 104]</a></span>

time, looking for
the tree on which she had seen the woodpecker,
when she saw, on the ground before her, a brown
beetle, or May-bug, lying upon his back. She took
him up, and turned him over.</p>

<p>&ldquo;That is a kind girl, Lizzy,&rdquo; said a
small voice.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Ah! the fairy!&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;How are you, this morning? I have not seen
you since last evening, when I was bobbing about
in your room, striking my head against the
ceiling, and then falling bounce upon the floor. I
was lying here on my back, just to see if you
would have the kindness to pick me up. And now,
tell me, what was the fate of the eggs? Have you
got some pretty bird, bright butterflies, and
shining beetles, to show me?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Ah! I am ashamed of myself,&rdquo; said
Lizzy; &ldquo;all your pretty eggs were wasted,
but one.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;No wasted,&rdquo; said the fairy;
&ldquo;you know yourself better than you did
yesterday&mdash;do you not?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Indeed, I do; and therefore I think I shall
succeed better to-day, if you will give me some
more eggs.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Oh, yes,&rdquo; said the fairy; and
taking the form of a squirrel, she ran up the tree
in which the eggs were concealed, and which was
not far distant, and presently returned with five
of them in her cheeks, which she gave to Lizzy,
and then ran up the tree again, and sat chattering
on a high bough. As

<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_105" id="Page_105">[Page&nbsp; 105]</a></span>

Lizzy walked on her way
homewards, she passed by a low meadow, where she
saw a little girl gathering cowslips, or May-blobs
for greens. She had a peck-basket beside her, and
Lizzy asked her if she meant to fill that great
basket with greens. The girl told her she should
have to fill it twice, and carry them into town to
sell. A glad thought leaped into Lizzy&rsquo;s
heart. &ldquo;I mean to try and help her to gather
them,&rdquo; said she to herself. When she offered
to do it, the little girl seemed quite pleased,
and so Lizzy went to work very industriously, and
broke off the leaves and buds of the May-blobs,
and the little girl&rsquo;s basket began to fill
very fast; and they talked together while they
picked, and the little girls soon became very well
acquainted with each other. The little girl told
Lizzy how many brothers and sisters she had, and
how many hens and chickens, and what all their
names were; and Lizzy told the little girl how
many brothers and sisters she had, and how many
rabbits and Canary birds, and what all their names
were; and the little girl told Lizzy how many
funny things her hens and chickens did; and Lizzy
told the little girl many knowing things that her
canaries did; and Lizzy felt as happy while she
picked the May-blobs, as the bright yellow
blossoms themselves looked. And now the basket is
full, and the little girl is glad her
morning&rsquo;s task is done, before the sun is up
so high as to be too warm; she is not going to
pick another basket till

<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_106" id="Page_106">[Page&nbsp; 106]</a></span>

towards night;&mdash;and now
Lizzy feels the egg-shell crack in her bosom, and
she and the little girl laugh to see a full-grown
yellow-bird fly out, and, alighting upon
Lizzy&rsquo;s shoulder, pour out his pleasant
song.</p>

<p>&ldquo;How he sings!&rdquo; said the little girl.</p>

<p>&ldquo;He is thanking me for his existence,&rdquo;
said Lizzy; for she had told the little girl all
about the fairy eggs. &ldquo;Come now, let me take
your basket, if you are going the same way that I
am; for I know you are tired, and I am not.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;That is where I live,&rdquo; said the
little girl, pointing to a house about an eighth
of a mile distant.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_107" id="Page_107">[Page&nbsp; 107]</a></span></p>

<p>&ldquo;Ah!&rdquo; said Lizzy, &ldquo;that is not
much out of my way; I think I shall be home in
good time.&rdquo; And she put another egg into her
bosom, and taking the basket, accompanied the
little girl home, telling her she would perhaps
come and help her again at night; and just as the
children were saying good-bye, a hen yellow-bird
flew out of Lizzy&rsquo;s bosom, and the other one
which had followed on, went gladly to meet her.
&ldquo;Ah! there is a little yellow mate for
him,&rdquo; cried Lizzy; and she held out her arm,
and the hen yellow-bird alighted upon it, and sat
there while her mate stood by her side and gave
her his prettiest song. The little girl went into
the house, and Lizzy, first putting another egg
into her bosom, walked on, the two birds flying
around her as she went, and the male now and then
stopping to trill his notes upon a shrub or tree.
When Lizzy reached home, she was met by Hero, her
brother&rsquo;s dog, and not in the most pleasant
manner imaginable. He had just come out of a muddy
ditch, and with his wet, black paws, up he leaped
upon her nice, clean apron. &ldquo;Be still, Hero;
down, down, sir,&rdquo; said Lizzy; but
Hero&rsquo;s expressions of joy were not so easily
quieted. Lizzy took up a stick and was going to
beat him, for she felt very angry; but she
controlled herself, and throwing down the stick,
took hold of Hero&rsquo;s collar and held him down
till he became more quiet. When she went into the
house the two yellow-birds flew up and alighted
upon a cherry tree, which was close by her chamber
window, and when she went into her chamber, how
pleasant was the song that met her ear! But why
did not the other egg hatch! Lizzy waited and
waited, and towards night her patience became
exhausted, and she broke the shell. Oh, how glad
she was it did not hatch! how glad she was that
she did not beat poor Hero, because he welcomed
her rather too rudely. A dead hornet was in the
egg shell.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_108" id="Page_108">[Page&nbsp; 108]</a></span></p>

<p>Lizzy&rsquo;s heart was full of gratitude and
love when she laid herself down to rest at night.
She loved the little girl she had helped, and she
felt penitent and humble when she thought how
angry she had been with Hero, and grateful when
she thought of the escape she had made; and she
felt very grateful and happy when she thought of
the two yellow-birds she should have to sing at
her window. She took the two remaining eggs in her
hands and held them up against her bosom, and
while she was going to sleep, sweet thoughts of
love and beauty floated about in her mind; and
when the song of her yellow-birds awoke her in the
morning&mdash;Oh, what was she pressing to her bosom? A
pair of white doves! and they nestled and cooed in
her bosom, and when she arose she let them play
around the chamber. Unlike the dark, filmy wings
of the bat, their white pinions whistled as they
flew, and Lizzy thought, &ldquo;Oh, how sweet it
will be to have these to nestle in my bosom every
night, and the yellow-birds to awaken me in the
morning!&rdquo;</p>

<h3>CORKING THE KETTLE SPOUT UP.</h3>


<p><span class="smcap">Mr. W.</span> Tom, have you brought the small cork I told
you to bring?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Tom.</span> Yes, father; here it is.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mr. W.</span> Put it in the kettle spout.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Tom.</span> Why, it blows it out again, as soon as it is
in.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mr. W.</span> You did not half press it in. Hold it
fast&mdash;press with all your strength.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Tom.</span> See there&mdash;the lid is blown off!</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mr. W.</span> Blown off! How is this?&mdash;nobody has put
gunpowder into the kettle!</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Ella.</span> I am sure there is nothing but clean water;
I saw it put in.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mr. W.</span> But, is it not very extraordinary that
simple, clean water, should blow the kettle lid
off?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Tom.</span> Not at all, father. When you told us about
the expansion of cold water below forty degrees,
we wondered, because we could not think ice was
more bulky than water; but there seems no

<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_112" id="Page_112">[Page&nbsp; 112]</a></span>

reason to doubt, that the hotter water becomes, the more
room it takes up.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mr. W.</span> How does the heat of the fire do this?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Tom.</span> By expanding it.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mr. W.</span> We know that; but how?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Tom.</span> By driving the particles of steam farther and
farther asunder.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mr. W.</span> Precisely. The moment the particles of a
drop of water become steam, they occupy eighteen
hundred times as much room as they did before.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Tom.</span> And press the lid eighteen hundred times more
forcibly than water?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mr. W.</span> Its force is altogether irresistible. If
this kettle were composed of iron, an inch thick
or more, if steam could not escape, it would burst
it with ease.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Tom.</span> Is that the reason why steam boilers burst?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mr. W.</span> It is one reason, but not the principal
one. If the water in the kettle were all boiled
out, and it was full of steam, and we corked it
tightly up, and soldered the lid down, and still
kept the fire blazing fiercely about it, it would
burst at the weakest part: perhaps the lid would
fly off, or the side burst: the steam would rush
out, and, if we were near, we might be scalded.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Tom.</span> Then, when a boiler grows old and thin, if
the pressure is very

<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_113" id="Page_113">[Page&nbsp; 113]</a></span>

great, it bursts in the weakest part?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mr. W.</span> Just so; and ingenious men have made some
portion of the boiler of a weaker metal&mdash;so that,
if it burst from the pressure of the steam, it
should hurt no one.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Amelia.</span> I cannot understand what you mean.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mr. W.</span> You see this kettle on the fire:&mdash;if we
cork up the spout, and fasten the lid down, and
let it boil, it will, probably, blow the cork out,
and hit some of you; but if, at the back part of
the kettle that touches the chimney, we have a
part of it made of lead, or tin, it will explode
there.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Amelia.</span> Oh! I see now.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Tom.</span> But, father, this cannot account for the
tremendous explosions, by which the boiler itself
is thrown a great distance, and even factories are
blown down.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mr. W.</span> I think not. I will try to make you
understand this, to-morrow.</p>

<h2><a name="THE_LOST_CHILDREN" id="THE_LOST_CHILDREN"></a>THE LOST CHILDREN.</h2>

<h3>A TRUE STORY.</h3>


<p>Philip and Jessie went to school every day through
a pretty lane that led to a small school-house in
the country. It was not far from their
mother&rsquo;s house, and it did not take them
many minutes to get there, when they did not stop
to play by the way. There were a great many
flowers growing in the field, on each side of the
path, and they often started a little earlier in
the morning, to gather some of the freshest to
carry to their kind teacher.</p>

<p>Philip was only eight years old, but he felt like
a man, when he thought he was two whole years
older than Jessie; and they had a little brother,
Willy, who was just three. Jessie was very fond of
taking care of &ldquo;the baby&rdquo; as Willy was
still called. How fast the little fellow used to
run when he saw Philip and Jessie coming up the
hill from school; and Philo, Philip&rsquo;s dog,
would bark, and run quite out of sight in a
minute, and then back again, and Jessie would put
her basket

<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_115" id="Page_115">[Page&nbsp; 115]</a></span>

 in his mouth, and he would walk along
by her side, while she led Willy to the house.</p>

<p>Willy often asked to go to school with his brother
and sister; but Mrs. Morton, their mother, was not
willing to let him go in, though his nurse often
took him to the door, and then brought him back,
for fear he should make a noise and disturb the
children at their lessons.</p>

<p>One fine afternoon, it was Philip&rsquo;s
birth-day, his mother said they might take Willy
with them to see &ldquo;Aunt Ellen,&rdquo; as they
used to call their teacher. He promised to sit
still by Jessie, and not speak one loud word; and
he kept his promise, too, though he whispered and
laughed so much, and looked so pretty, that the
little girls did not do much work that afternoon.
However, Aunt Ellen dismissed the school half an
hour earlier than usual; and as they ran out,
shouting and jumping, she stooped and kissed
Willy, and told Jessie to say, to his mother, that
he had been a very good boy in school, and that
she hoped soon to have him for a scholar.</p>

<p>Mrs. Morton had charged Philip to come straight
from school, and not stop by the way for anything,
and he had promised her to do so;&mdash;but the sun was
so high, and shone so pleasantly, that they did
not walk very fast at first, for Willy would stop
to pluck every flower he saw, to carry home, he
said, to mamma.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_116" id="Page_116">[Page&nbsp; 116]</a></span></p>

<p>So they went along, and did not attend to the
time, but began to gather blackberries, and were
delighted to see Willy eat them, and put them into
their basket. They were all so busily engaged,
that they entirely forgot what their mother had
told them when they left home, and had wandered a
good way from the path, when Philip looked up, for
it was becoming quite dark. The sun had gone under
a cloud, and it began to rain; so Philip tied on
Jessie&rsquo;s hat, and they both took Willy by
the hand, and ran, as they thought, towards home,
but it was quite another way. The rain came down,
now, very fast, and it thundered at a distance,
which frightened them a little. Poor Jessie pulled
Willy along, who began to cry, for his shoe was
coming off. She could not stop to tie it on; and
then they both fell over the stump of a tree, and
Jessie spilt all her blackberries over her dress
and Willy&rsquo;s apron, which were already wet
with the rain. Then Jessie could not help crying
too; but Philip helped him up, and told him they
would soon get home now.</p>

<p>As they were near the woods, that were very thick,
Philip said they had better stop a little while
till the rain ceased, and then go on; but it grew
so dark, and kept on raining so fast, they could
not see which way to go. They sat down on a great
stone under a thick grape-vine that kept off the
wet, and Jessie took &ldquo;the baby&rdquo; in her
arms, and tied her

<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_117" id="Page_117">[Page&nbsp; 117]</a></span>

handkerchief around his neck.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I want to go to mamma,&rdquo; he cried.
&ldquo;Take me home,&mdash;I want to go to
mamma!&rdquo;</p>

<p>So did Jessie too, but she tried hard not to cry
to keep Willy still.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Do you think we are lost, Philip?&rdquo;
she said.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I am afraid so,&rdquo; replied Philip.
&ldquo;But, Jessie, I have often read about lost
children, and that some good person came to take
care of them.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;But if Willy should die like one of those
babes in the wood, that nurse Annie sings about,
all stained with blackberries&mdash;Oh, Philip! we were
so naughty to pick blackberries!&rdquo; and the
tears came so fast she could not speak.</p>

<p>The rain was now over, and the stars shone
brightly, and Philip thought perhaps they could
hear him at home if he called; so he went out of
the wood a little way, and called out as loud as
he could, &ldquo;Father! Mother! we are
here!&rdquo; He repeated it till he was quite
hoarse, but he could not make them hear. He saw an
old shed not far off, and he told Jessie that he
thought they had better go there, and stay till
some one found them.</p>

<p>They took their brother in their arms between
them, and reached the shed, where they found some
hay, and Philip made a bed for Jessie and Willy as
well as he could, and put his coat over it. Jessie
took off Willy&rsquo;s apron and hung it up inside
the shed to dry, and took off his wet stockings
and one shoe, for he had lost the other, and held
his feet in her lap, to keep them warm. As she
sat

<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_118" id="Page_118">[Page&nbsp; 118]</a></span>

down beside him on the ground, she began
singing him to sleep&mdash;</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">&ldquo;Hush my dear, lie still and slumber,<br /></span>
<span class="i2">Holy angels guard thy bed,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Heavenly blessings without number<br /></span>
<span class="i2">Gently fall upon thy head!&rdquo;<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>She could not sing any more, for she thought of
her mother, who sung this hymn to them every
night, and of the quiet little room where she
slept with Willy so warm and comfortable, and
father and mother and Philip near; and now they
were all in the dark, and lost in the wood!</p>

<p>Philip was as sad as Jessie, but he did not cry,
and he said,&mdash;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Jessie, may be, if we pray to God, he will
send some one to find us, and take us home.
Don&rsquo;t you remember how often aunt Ellen has
told us that God sees little children, and
everybody, in the night as well as in the day, and
that good angels are around us, though we cannot
see them? I was a very naughty boy to stop when
mother told me to bring Willy straight home from
school, and I will pray to God to forgive me, and
find you and me and the baby!&rdquo;</p>

<p>So they both kneeled down, and took hold of each
other&rsquo;s hands, and said their prayers.</p>

<p>Willy was fast asleep now, and Jessie laid down
beside him, and put her arm around his neck&mdash;but
she could not sleep, and hearing a noise close
by,

<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_119" id="Page_119">[Page&nbsp; 119]</a></span>

she got up and went to Philip, and asked him
what he thought it could be.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I will go and see,&rdquo; said Philip.</p>

<p>He went out, and soon coming back, told her it was
only a horse quietly feeding on the short grass
that grew in the wood, and that he was tied to the
shed by a long rope, to keep him from running
away.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Philip,&rdquo; said Jessie,
&ldquo;don&rsquo;t you think some one may come in
the morning to get the horse, and find
<i>us</i>?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yes! to be sure they will,&rdquo; said
Philip; &ldquo;and I will tell them my name is
Philip Morton, and may be they may know my father,
and then they can show us the way home.&rdquo;</p>

<p>And so these little children found comfort in
thinking they would not be deserted, even though
away from their parents, and lost in the thick
wood; for their Father in heaven was watching over
them, and allowing the good angels to put this
thought into their head, to cheer them, so that
they were not afraid.</p>

<p>All this while their parents and friends were out
looking for them everywhere; for Mrs. Morton,
seeing the dark cloud arise, and finding that the
children did not come home, was very uneasy. At
first, she was sure that they would be in
directly, as Philip had always been so obedient to
her, and so careful of his brother and sister. But
night coming on, and seeing nothing of them, she
became

<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_120" id="Page_120">[Page&nbsp; 120]</a></span>

greatly alarmed. She went out herself with
nurse Annie, and looked and called in vain. When
Mr. Morton came home, he found her in the deepest
distress, for all her children were gone, she knew
not whither, and it was dark and raining, and
there was a mill-race and pond not far off, where
the children had often walked with her and their
father,&mdash;and oh! if they had lost their way and
fallen in there! Mr. Morton, and some gentlemen in
the neighbourhood, who kindly lent their
assistance, took lanterns, and all went out, some
on foot and some on horseback, to search far and
near for them.</p>

<p>It was about two o&rsquo;clock in the morning when
the children thought they heard some one calling
them. They listened&mdash;no! they could not mistake
their father&rsquo;s voice calling, &ldquo;Philip!
Philip! Jessie!&rdquo;</p>

<p>Oh! how their hearts beat! Philip ran farther into
the wood and called again, &ldquo;Father! Father!
here we are!&rdquo;</p>

<p>But no answer was returned. Just then they saw a
light through the trees, at a distance, and
Philip, running in the direction, saw his father,
and their old man Tom, and Philo. Presently Philo
barked, and Philip knew, by the sound, that they
were all coming towards them.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t leave me, Philip!&rdquo; cried
out little Jessie. &ldquo;I will take the baby up,
if you will help me.&rdquo;</p>

<p>So Philip ran back to the shed, and called again.
His father heard him now, and came directly up to

<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_121" id="Page_121">[Page&nbsp; 121]</a></span>

where they were. There he found Willy fast asleep,
and Jessy trying to put on his apron and shoe.</p>

<p>Old Tommy had a bundle of shawls, and some cakes
for them, that their mother had put up.&mdash;They were
so glad to see their father, and to know that they
were found, that they did not care for the cakes;
but Jessie took a shawl for herself, and her
father wrapped one around Willy, who opened his
eyes, and seeing his father had him, fell asleep
again.</p>

<p>They were soon on their way home,&mdash;Philo running
on before them, as if to be the first to announce
their coming; and Tommy, with Philip on one
side,&mdash;and Jessy, holding her little school-basket
in her hand, on the other; and Mr. Morton with the
baby.</p>

<p>Mrs. Morton ran to meet them, and I cannot say who
were the happier,&mdash;the children, to be once more
safe at home, or the mother to hold again her
darlings in her arms!</p>

<p>&ldquo;Mother, I am afraid you will never trust
Willy with me again,&rdquo; was the first thing
Philip said.&mdash;&ldquo;But, indeed, I will never
disobey you again. I did not know what a terrible
thing it is to be naughty!&rdquo;</p>

<p>His mother could not speak&mdash;she wept; but it was
with joy and gratitude to God for restoring to her
her children.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_122" id="Page_122">[Page&nbsp; 122]</a></span></p>

<p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t cry so; indeed I think God
will make me a good boy, after this,
always,&rdquo; said Philip, looking up earnestly
in his mother&rsquo;s face.</p>

<p>&ldquo;May He indeed do so, my dear boy, and ever
bless, and strengthen you!&rdquo; said his mother.
&ldquo;May you never forget to obey your father
and mother, now you are young, and I am sure you
will be a good <i>man</i>.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Philip never forgot the night in the woods. He is
now grown up, and what his mother said was true.
He is a good man, because he learned to be a good
boy.</p>

<h2><a name="THE_TWO_NOSEGAYS" id="THE_TWO_NOSEGAYS"></a>THE TWO NOSEGAYS.</h2>


<p>One fine summer evening, as the mother of Virginia
and Maria was walking with them in the garden, she
observed that, from time to time, they went away
by themselves, and whispered mysteriously
together; and whenever she went towards them, to
inquire into the subject of their conversation,
they stopped, and began to play about.</p>

<p>This conduct disturbed her very much; for she knew
that when girls have anything which they wish to
conceal from their mothers, there must be
something wrong about it.</p>

<p>This case, however, was an exception to the
general rule, Virginia and Maria had nothing
improper in their minds; but the next day was
their mother&rsquo;s birth-day, and they wished to
think of something which would be a suitable
present for them to make her.</p>

<p>Virginia was two years older than Maria, and the
two sisters were very different. Virginia was
lively, quick, and graceful; Maria was quiet,

<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_125" id="Page_125">[Page&nbsp; 125]</a></span>

modest, and loving.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Let us make mamma some present which will
prove which of us possesses the finest
taste,&rdquo; said Virginia. &ldquo;In our garden
and the meadow the flowers are all striving to see
which will excel in beauty. Let us choose, from
among them, the flowers we like best, and make a
nosegay, each by ourselves; and then see which our
mother will prefer.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Maria agreed to her sister&rsquo;s proposal, and,
early on the next morning, they went, by different
paths, through the meadow and garden, to make
their choice. All the flowers smiled upon them,
and seemed to invite attention: but they flew,
like butterflies, from one to the other, uncertain
where to choose. At length the early morning was
gone, and it was time for them to return to
breakfast.&mdash;They both knew that a want of
<i>punctuality</i> would displease their mother, more
than any nosegays could give her pleasure. So they
broke off their flowers hastily, and carried them
to the house, without even suffering each other to
see what they had.</p>

<p>Soon after breakfast, Virginia approached her
mother with a smile of satisfaction, and very
gracefully presented her a bunch of fresh
moss-roses, in a little basket curiously woven of
the green leaves of the bush.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_126" id="Page_126">[Page&nbsp; 126]</a></span></p>

<p>&ldquo;Dear mother!&rdquo; said she, &ldquo;see
how, from this little basket of leaves, this
full-blown moss-rose lifts up its head in the
centre, with a colour so lively and so soft. This
beautiful rose is you, mother, and this little bud
beneath its shadow is your Virginia.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Maria approached with a timid step, and spoke in a
low, hesitating voice:</p>

<p>&ldquo;Mother, here is my nosegay. It is not so
beautiful nor ingenious as Virginia&rsquo;s
rose-basket.&mdash;It is only a bunch of honeysuckle
blossoms, from the vine which twined around the
nut-tree, as I would rest on you.&rdquo;</p>

<p>When Maria said this, she threw her arms around
her mother&rsquo;s neck, and wet her cheeks with
tears of quiet love.</p>

<p>The beauty and ingenuity of the rose-basket had
delighted the eye of the happy mother, but
Maria&rsquo;s present touched her heart; and tears
filled her eyes, as she returned the embrace of
her affectionate child.</p>

<p>&ldquo;My dear children,&rdquo; said she,
&ldquo;your gifts are like yourselves, and you
shall both be precious to me.&rdquo;</p>

<p>As she said this, she took the rose-bud from the
basket, and twining it with the honeysuckles, put
them both into her bosom.</p>

<h2><a name="CAMGNO_OR_THE_TAME_ROE" id="CAMGNO_OR_THE_TAME_ROE"></a>CAMGNO; OR, THE TAME ROE.</h2>

<h3>A TRUE STORY.</h3>


<p>And now, little girls, I am going to tell you of
the life and history of a young roe-deer. It is
quite a true story, as I have very good reason to
know.</p>

<p>When Fanny Grey was about seven years old, one day
her father opened the door of the room where she
sat, and said, &ldquo;Come here, Fanny, and look
at the beautiful present I have brought
you.&rdquo;</p>

<p>So she got up in great haste, and followed her
papa to the lawn, and there, in a nice square box,
was a young roe.</p>

<p>&ldquo;It is for you, my child, as a reward for
your attention to your studies.&rdquo;</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_128" id="Page_128">[Page&nbsp; 128]</a></span></p>

<p>I wish you could have seen Fanny&rsquo;s joy. She
danced about, and clapped her hands, and ran to
the dairy to get some milk for the little
stranger. When she had taken it out of the box,
she could see it much better: she could see the
white spots that make the coat of roe-deer, when
they are very young. She could see its pretty
little graceful feet, and its soft, black eyes;
and Fanny was so happy, that she said she should
like it better than any of her pets. She had
birds, and dogs, and a beautiful grey horse, but
this dear little roe was better than all. She gave
it the name of Camgno; and by this name it would
come whenever she called.&mdash;She made a velvet
cushion for it to sleep upon, and every day she
thought it grew more pretty. After some time
Camgno became quite strong, and Fanny had a silver
collar made for it; and the gamekeeper made a
&ldquo;nice little house&rdquo; for her favourite,
where it could sleep every night. Camgno would
always come when Fanny called, and they loved each
other very much. But Camgno was taken

<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_129" id="Page_129">[Page&nbsp; 129]</a></span>

sick, and it was necessary to carry him to the
pheasant-house, where the gamekeeper could take
care of him; for Fanny was not old enough to take
all the care of her little pet, when he was so
sick, and so she consented to its being removed.</p>

<p>One day her father came home and told her a sad
tale, that Camgno could not live. Oh! how sorry
she was!&mdash;the tears came into her eyes, and she
ran away, as fast as she could, to see her poor
roe. When she came to the pheasant-house, Camgno
was lying on the ground, and looked quite dead.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Oh, my poor Camgno!&rdquo; she cried.</p>

<p>Camgno opened its black eyes at the sound of her
voice; and Fanny sat down by the roe, and raised
its little head, and laid it upon her knee.&mdash;She
staid a long time beside her dear little pet, till
her father said he was afraid she would catch
cold, and she must now go home.</p>

<p>The next morning she got up very early, and went
to the gamekeeper; but just before she reached the
house, she met James, who said, &ldquo;It is of no
use; Camgno is dead; but if I live till another
spring, I will get you another roe.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Thank you James,&rdquo; said Fanny;
&ldquo;but I shall never want another roe; it
might die too; and it makes me very sorry: but I
will thank you to dig a grave for my <i>pet</i>, and
help me to bury it.&rdquo;</p>

<p>So Fanny covered the grave with flowers, and
resolved that she would try and not love anything

<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_130" id="Page_130">[Page&nbsp; 130]</a></span>

so much again that could be taken away from her;
but she was always kind to all animals, and every
living thing,&mdash;and, after this, she was led to
think of and love such things as could not be
taken away from her: and that made her truly
happy.</p>

<h2><a name="THE_SECRET" id="THE_SECRET"></a>THE SECRET.</h2>


<p>&ldquo;Come, Fanny,&rdquo; said George Lewis,
&ldquo;put on your hat, and go out with me among
the trees and bushes. It is a bright, glorious
morning, and I have a secret to reveal to you,
sister, when we get where nobody will overhear
us.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Oh, that&rsquo;s grand,&rdquo; cried Fanny,
with her face kindling up with joy, and her
curiosity, like herself, all on tiptoe. &ldquo;I
love to find out secrets.&rdquo;</p>

<p>She took her brother&rsquo;s hand, and away they
hied, running and leaping, over the field, past
the new hayricks, across the rivulet, and into the
flowery border of a thicket. Here was a little
silvery fountain, gushing from a mossy rock, and
flashing to the light over its pebbly basin; and
there a green, arching bough, hung with clusters
of wild berries, and trembling from the weight and
motion of their light-winged gatherer; while the
air was filled with sweet perfume, and the songs
of the feathered warblers sounded from shrub and
tree on every side.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_132" id="Page_132">[Page&nbsp; 132]</a></span></p>

<p>&ldquo;But what <i>is</i> it&mdash;what <i>can</i> it be that
you have to tell me, George?&rdquo; said Fanny;
&ldquo;I&rsquo;m out of breath to know the
secret.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Be patient, and you shall know it in the
right time,&rdquo; replied her brother.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Oh! how can you be so cruel as not to tell
me <i>now</i>?&rdquo; said Fanny. &ldquo;How long have
you known the secret without letting me know it,
too? I shan&rsquo;t be able to go much farther, if
you keep it from me. My heart is all in a
flutter.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t want to tell you, with your
heart all in a <i>flutter</i>. You should be calm, so
as to hear what I say, and to enjoy the sight I
have to show you,&rdquo; said the young
philosopher.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I am calm, now, and I have been
patient,&rdquo; said Fanny. &ldquo;Come, dear
Georgie, do tell me.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Georgie kept silence, and proceeded a few paces,
when he paused; and lifting a long, leafy branch,
disclosed to the eye of the delighted girl a
beautiful nest, full of young birds, so closely
snuggled in their little round cell, that they
looked as if, from below the neck, they grew
together.</p>

<p>In momentary surprise at the sudden flood of light
that poured upon them, the nestlings put up their
heads, as if to ask what was meant by it, and who
it was that had unroofed them. They had never
received anything but what came from care and
kindness; they were innocent, and therefore they
knew no fear. Putting forth their open beaks at
the strange visitants, they cried,
&ldquo;Petweet-tweet, petweet-tweet,&rdquo; as if

<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_133" id="Page_133">[Page&nbsp; 133]</a></span>

their mother had hung over them with their
morning gift of food.</p>

<p>Fanny was for a moment as much surprised as they.
Then, in an ecstacy of delight, she sprang
forward, and would have dislodged the nest from
its place, to take the birds, and examine them
with her fingers, as well as her scrutinizing eye,
had not her brother checked her motion, and stood
between her and his casket of living jewels.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Oh! I want to touch them!&rdquo; said she.
&ldquo;But how long have you known of this
nest?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Ever since it was begun to be built,&rdquo;
said George.</p>

<p>&ldquo;And didn&rsquo;t tell <i>m-e</i>!&rdquo; said
Fanny, in a whimpering tone.</p>

<p>&ldquo;No,&rdquo; replied George, &ldquo;but I
will tell you the reason why I did not. Had I told
you then, Fanny, we should never have seen these
little birds here. You haven&rsquo;t the art of
keeping a secret belonging to your own concerns or
another&rsquo;s, long enough for anything
depending on its being kept to come to pass. You
will surely, in some way, let it slip too soon.
You would not tell it if you promised not to do
so; but by some air or act, or mysterious manner,
you would show them that you knew something that
was unknown to others, and set them to watching
and studying for it. If I had told you of the
nest, you would have wanted to be running out
every little while to see how it went on, till the
bird would have found herself watched, and
forsaken

<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_134" id="Page_134">[Page&nbsp; 134]</a></span>

it, to build somewhere else. Or you would
have wanted to break the blue shells, to see if
the insides of the eggs were growing into birds;
just as you dug up your flower-seeds, to know if
they were sprouted; and broke open the green
rose-buds, to find out if the under leaves were
turning red. So your seeds never came up, and your
roses didn&rsquo;t bloom; all for your impatience
and curiosity. If you had not done this, your
continual coming would have drawn the attention of
some of the boys or girls, to learn what was here,
till they would have found the nest, and robbed
it. You have too much <i>curiosity</i>, Fanny. If you
choose, tell your own secrets, and take the
consequences. But they who cannot keep their own,
are not very likely to be trusted with those of
others. And as to coming at them by prying, I
should feel as if I was &lsquo;tiefing,&rsquo; as
the Frenchman told his little boy he had been
doing, when he cut the shoot from
grandpapa&rsquo;s English walnut-tree, to make him
a <i>rattan</i>. If I discovered, by accident, what
concerned another, and was not designed for my
knowledge, I should feel sorry, and that I had no
more right to tell or expose it, than I should
have to spend a piece of money that I saw another
drop. This secret was the <i>bird&rsquo;s</i>&mdash;and I
should have caused her great distress by telling
it. It is the kind of curiosity which makes you
want to know what others are about, what they
have, and so on, that gets you into your worst
troubles, sister. You

<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_135" id="Page_135">[Page&nbsp; 135]</a></span>

saw John bring in a covered
basket, and put it on a shelf in the cellar
closet. The next that was heard was the basket,
eggs and all, smash upon the brick floor; and
sister Fanny shouting lamentably and crying,
&lsquo;Oh, dear, dear, they are all over my
feet!&rsquo; So none of us had pudding that day.
Then, when you saw your mother wet her eyes with
clear water from a phial, and thought you&rsquo;d
try it too, you found the sal volatile not quite
so cooling to yours, as the rose-water to hers. No
wonder that they wept!</p>

<p>&ldquo;Now, Fanny, since I&rsquo;ve played
minister, and preached you such a sermon on
curiosity over this nest, I know you&rsquo;ll
prove so good a hearer as not to show that you
know anything about the secret, till the birds are
a few days older, and can fly away.&mdash;Then
they&rsquo;ll come and do the singing part of the
service, from the trees around our house.&rdquo;</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_136" id="Page_136">[Page&nbsp; 136]</a></span></p>

<p>Fanny looked thoughtful and solemn, and only
replied, &ldquo;I&rsquo;m glad I didn&rsquo;t
break the bird&rsquo;s eggs. There never would
have been any music nor pretty birds come from
these if I did break them. They would have been
made into a pudding; the pudding would have made
me heavy and sleepy, so that I should not have got
my lesson so well, and I should have been
mortified at school.&rdquo;</p>

<h2><a name="SCIENCE_OF_THE_HUMAN_FRAME" id="SCIENCE_OF_THE_HUMAN_FRAME"></a>SCIENCE OF THE HUMAN FRAME.</h2>

<h3>THE SKIN.</h3>


<p><span class="smcap">Father.</span> It is pleasant and profitable, my
children, to learn the uses of various parts of
the human body; for when we understand the uses of
any member of the body, and the manner in which it
is composed, we shall be better able to avoid all
things which would interfere with those uses. It
seems to me that it would be useful for you to
give your attention to these subjects, and I will
give you all the assistance that I am able.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Albert.</span> I wish to learn the use of a great many
parts of my body that I do not now fully
understand; for I have been told that the human
form is the most perfect of all material things;
and it seems to me that we ought to give much more
attention to it than we have yet given.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Charles.</span> It seems to me that it would be a good
plan, if you are willing, father, to spend a part
of each evening in teaching us these things.
Albert and I can ask some questions, and you can

<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_137" id="Page_137">[Page&nbsp; 137]</a></span>

answer them, and give us any other information
that you think may be useful to us.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Father.</span> I think that this is a good plan; and as
we are now together, we will begin this evening.
We will begin with the <i>skin</i>,&mdash;for though the
skin covers the whole body, and is so exposed to
view, there are many things concerning it with
which you are not familiar.&mdash;The skin is that thin
covering which is spread over the whole surface of
the body. It serves to bind together and to
protect from injury the more delicate parts which
are beneath it. Come, Albert, tell me some of the
things which you have observed respecting the
skin.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Albert.</span> The skin differs in its appearance in
different animals, and in different parts of the
body. With young people and females it is soft,
smooth, and delicate; it is firmer and more
resisting in middle age, and with males; it
appears loose and wrinkled in old age, and after
some diseases; it is puckered or disposed in folds
in places where it would otherwise interfere with
the proper movements of the limbs, as over the
finger-joints, and in the palm of the hand.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Father.</span> Very well, my son. Should you suppose,
Charles, that the skin is one sheet, or that it is
composed of layers?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Charles.</span> I have observed that a very thin coat of
the skin has sometimes risen in blisters, from
being rubbed when I have been working, or from a
burn, or slight scald; and sometimes I have

<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_138" id="Page_138">[Page&nbsp; 138]</a></span>

peeled it off, as I can the outside bark of a
birch tree; and from these things I suppose the
skin is composed of thin layers.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Father.</span> It is so. The skin is composed of three
membranes, or layers. The outside layer is called
the &ldquo;cuticle,&rdquo; or
&ldquo;scarf-skin.&rdquo; There are some other
names for the three layers of the skin besides
those that I shall use; but if you remember those
which I give, it will be sufficient until you are
old enough to understand more fully the good books
which have been written concerning the different
parts of the body. The cuticle has no
blood-vessels. It is very thin. There is still
some doubt whether the scarf-skin has any nerves
or not. Perhaps it has nerves which are so
unsusceptible to external impressions, that we do
not notice their effects.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Albert.</span> If there were nerves in the scarf-skin as
sensitive as those in some parts of the body, we
should be in constant pain; we could not take a
single step without extreme pain; for the
scarf-skin is, I suppose, a protection to the
parts which are tender; and unless its nerves were
blunt, it would not answer this purpose. I never
thought of this before; but this, as well as the
structure of every part of the body, shows us the
kindness and wisdom of our Creator.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Charles.</span> And if there were blood-vessels in the
scarf-skin, we should continually be in danger of
being covered with blood, since a slight blow is
sufficient to break this skin. I have also
observed,

<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_139" id="Page_139">[Page&nbsp; 139]</a></span>

father, that those parts of the body
which are the most exposed to pressure and
friction, such as the palms of the hands and soles
of the feet, are provided with a scarf-skin much
thicker than that on other parts of the body.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Father.</span> Yes, my son. The difference in the
thickness of the cuticle in different parts of the
body is apparent even at birth. But the farmer and
blacksmith, who are constantly engaged in manual
labour, need a thicker scarf-skin to protect their
hands, than would be convenient for a student or a
merchant; and it has, for this reason, been so
provided, that the scarf-skin increases in
thickness when it is much used, and decreases when
it is but little needed.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Charles.</span> If we have got through with talking about
the scarf-skin, I should like to ask about the
next layer, for you told us there are three coats.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Father.</span> Yes, there are three coats. Immediately
beneath the scarf-skin, is what is called the
<i>mucous coat</i>. The mucous coat is chiefly
remarkable as the seat of the colouring matter of
the skin.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Albert.</span> Then I should think that persons of dark
complexion must have much thicker mucous coats
than those of light complexion.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Father.</span> They have. It can scarcely be seen with
those who are of a very light complexion, but in
the negro it is thick. If the mucous coat were the
same in all persons, all would be of one colour.

<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_140" id="Page_140">[Page&nbsp; 140]</a></span>

The mucous coat is very bright in those fishes and
other animals whose skins have beautiful,
variegated colours, and is the cause of their
brilliant appearance. The mucous coat, like the
cuticle, is destitute of blood-vessels, and of
very active nerves.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Albert.</span> As it is not yet late, let us talk about
the third layer, and then we shall have some idea
of the composition of the skin.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Father.</span> The third, or inmost layer, called the
<i>true skin</i>, is much thicker than either of the
other layers of the skin. The true skin seems to
be a complete network of extremely small
blood-vessels and nerves.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Charles.</span> I can see that this is so; for I cannot
prick entirely through the skin, even with the
point of the finest needle, without giving some
pain, and drawing some blood; and I suppose that
the pain is caused by piercing a nerve, and the
bleeding by opening a blood-vessel.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Father.</span> You are right, my son. There are so many
nerves in the true skin, that in amputating a
limb, the principal pain is always in the skin.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Albert.</span> I suppose we should not be able to
distinguish different things by the touch, unless
the true skin were furnished with nerves.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Father.</span> One of the great uses of the skin is to
remove from the body the impure matter which is
constantly collecting. You both have, when warm,
perceived drops of sweat, or perspiration, on

<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_141" id="Page_141">[Page&nbsp; 141]</a></span>

your faces and other parts of your bodies. Much
impure matter is removed in that way, which, if
not removed, would be very injurious to the
health.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Charles.</span> It seems to me that but very little
impure matter can be conveyed away in the
perspiration which falls from us.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Father.</span> Even when we cannot perceive the
perspiration, there is what is called <i>insensible</i>
perspiration, by which, in a state of health,
about twenty ounces of waste matter are daily
removed. When a person takes a sudden cold, this
perspiration is checked, and the waste matter
accumulates, and causes sickness. Perspiration
takes place with much more regularity when the
body is kept perfectly clean, than when it is
allowed to remain dirty; and from this we can see
how necessary it is to bathe the body thoroughly
and frequently, and also that we ought to avoid
exposing ourselves to take cold.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Albert.</span> I thank you, father, for explaining these
things, and will try to remember them.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Charles.</span> And so do I: and I hope that another
evening we shall learn much more.</p>

<h2><a name="KING_ALFRED" id="KING_ALFRED"></a>KING ALFRED.</h2>


<p>Alfred was one of the early kings of England,
distinguished for his wisdom and virtue. In his
childhood he was very much indulged by his
parents, and his education was neglected, but he
engaged in study of his own accord, and became an
eminent scholar in his youth; although in those
days there were no printed books, and few means of
instruction of any kind.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_146" id="Page_146">[Page&nbsp; 146]</a></span></p>

<p>When he became king, after the death of his
father, his country was suffering from the
invasion of the Danes; and Alfred spent a
considerable part of his life in wars with them.
These Danes came over in swarms from the continent
of Europe, under different leaders; and they
succeeded in defeating the armies sent out against
them, one after another, and in extending their
ravages over so many parts of the kingdom, that
the people of the island were reduced to despair.
The army was dispersed, and Alfred had to fly and
conceal himself, to save his life. He finally went
to service in the family of a herdsman,&mdash;a sort of
farmer, who had care of the cattle,&mdash;where he was
once well scolded by the herdsman&rsquo;s wife for
letting some cakes burn. Hume, the historian,
relates the story in the following language:&mdash;</p>

<p>&ldquo;The wife of the neat-herd was ignorant of
the condition of our royal guest, and observing
him one day busy by the fireside, in trimming his
bow and arrows, she desired him to take care of
some cakes which were toasting, while she was
employed elsewhere, in other domestic affairs. But
Alfred, whose thoughts were otherwise engaged,
neglected his injunction; and the good woman, on
her return, finding her cakes all burnt, rated the
king very severely, and upbraided him, that he
always seemed very well pleased to eat her warm
cakes, though he was thus negligent in toasting
them.&rdquo;</p>

<p>After this, Alfred contrived to collect some of
his followers, and to conceal himself with them in
the centre of a vast tract of swampy land. The
piece of firm ground on which he established his
company, contained only about two acres. Here he
remained a year, though he often went on
excursions against the enemy. Finally, his
strength increased, so that he was prepared to
adopt still more decisive measures. He accordingly
formed a plan for a general mustering of the
forces of the kingdom, in order to make a combined
and effectual attack upon the Danes. At this time,
another incident occurred, which has helped to
make Alfred

<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_147" id="Page_147">[Page&nbsp; 147]</a></span>

famous. He concluded, before
summoning the army together, that he would go into
the camp of the Danes, in disguise, in order to
see what their strength and condition were. So he
procured a harp, and dressed himself in the
disguise of a harper. In those days, harpers were
accustomed to wander about towns and armies,
playing for the amusement of those who would pay
them. Alfred seems to have acted his part very
successfully. He not only entertained the soldiers
and officers with his harp, but he amused them
with tales and jokes, and finally he made his way
into the tent of Guthrum, the general. There,
Alfred learned all he wished to know, and then
returned to his own camp. This was a very
dangerous experiment, for if anything had occurred
even to arouse the suspicions of the Danes, he
would have been hung at once.</p>

<p>Immediately after this, Alfred sent messengers
through the kingdom and called his army together,
and, after several battles, expelled the Danes
from the country. He then evinced great wisdom in
the arrangements which he made for reducing the
kingdom to regular order. He founded the most
useful institutions, and restored the dominion of
law and public tranquillity. He has been always
regarded as a great benefactor of the
English nation.

<h2><a name="GRACE_MIDDLETON" id="GRACE_MIDDLETON"></a>GRACE MIDDLETON.</h2>


<p>Grace was returning from a distant part of the
country to her own loved home; she had been living
with a relation, and a long time had passed since
she had heard from, or listened to the gentle

<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_149" id="Page_149">[Page&nbsp; 149]</a></span>

voice of her parents; (there was no mail in that
part of the country;) and as she drew near to each
loved haunt of her early childhood, her heart beat
quick with sweet anticipations of delight. She
fancied her brother and sister very much grown,
but still as loving and happy as when she last
sported with them on the grass-plat by the cottage
door. It was evening when Grace descended the
long, sloping hill, at the foot of which was an
extensive avenue of tall oak trees, leading
directly to the cottage, and the declining sun
cast a melancholy shadow over the face of this
well-remembered spot, once resounding with the
shouts of happy infancy.</p>

<p>The heart of Grace grew sad as she drew near the
cottage, and she wondered very much that no one
was in sight. At length she hears the well-known
bark of old Carlo;&mdash;&ldquo;but where are my
parents, my brother and sister! I thought to find
them <i>all</i> here; where are they?&rdquo;</p>

<p>Alas! alas! she soon ascertained they were all
gone; all, save her aged grandfather, who comes
with feeble step to embrace and welcome her.
&ldquo;The Lord bless you, my child, and blessed
be his name for restoring you to me in my old age;
come with me, and let us give thanks to our
heavenly Father, for all his blessings. It is true
he has seen best to remove those we love most from
us; but it is all right, my child, all
right;&rdquo; and he led her into the cottage,
where the evening

<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_150" id="Page_150">[Page&nbsp; 150]</a></span>

meal was spread for them by the
kind old housekeeper; but it was a sad meal for
Grace, and she soon hastened to her chamber to
weep and meditate on the change which had taken
place in her absence, and to think of what she
ought to do.</p>

<p>It was the spring of the year&mdash;and when Grace
arose from her bed the next morning, and looked
forth from the window of her little room, and saw
all Nature smiling with beauty, she felt
refreshed; and as she gazed on the beautiful
flowers that grew beneath her window, and listened
to the songs of the birds, and the gentle murmurs
of the little stream which watered the garden, she
felt that she had much to be thankful for, and
that good spirits were near to make her happy; and
when she met her old grandfather in the library,
where it was the custom to assemble the family for
morning prayers, her eyes expressed the peace and
devotion which she felt; and while they partook of
the repast prepared for them, in the
well-remembered breakfast-room, they talked over
the trying events of the past with humble
resignation. Grace was very thankful to find that
she could, in various ways, make herself useful to
her only relation; and in arranging the occupation
of her time, the garden was to be under her
care&mdash;to employ and amuse her as one of her
principal things; and in a short time, she had
made so many improvements, that her

<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_151" id="Page_151">[Page&nbsp; 151]</a></span>

grandfather said it was quite a little paradise.</p>

<p>The rivulet, which flowed through the garden, had
many flowers growing on its borders; and here
Grace delighted to ramble, for it reminded her of
other and happy days, when she had been used to
gather the flowers, with her little sisters, to
make nosegays for her parents.</p>

<p>One day, when she was walking beneath the trees of
the garden, she saw a beautiful bird building its
nest on one of the branches. This was a new source
of delight to her; and when the nest was finished,
and a little brood of beautiful birds were heard
chirping in the trees, Grace thought there was but
one thing more she desired, and that was a
pleasant seat for her grandfather, where he might
sit in the heat of the day, and enjoy his nap, or
read his favourite book undisturbed; so she built
him a bower, and planted the choicest flowers
about it, and watered them morning and evening,
that they might grow and flourish; and while she
did so, she prayed that <i>good affections</i> might
grow in her own heart, and expand like these
flowers; and they did so, for, as she grew in
years, she grew in wisdom and love.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_152" id="Page_152">[Page&nbsp; 152]</a></span></p>

<p>Several years passed in this peaceful retirement
and the care of her good grandfather,&mdash;who was now
quite old, and whose white locks and feeble step
reminded her that <i>he</i> would be called to join
those who had gone before him. But for this she
was prepared; for he had often spoken to her of
death&mdash;he had made this subject familiar to her,
and he had tried as much as possible to elevate
her mind above the grave, that she might think of
her departed friends as near to her, and still
living in a more perfect state; and she knew it
would be far better for him to go and live with
his heavenly Father, than to remain in this world,
even though they might continue to be very happy
together; and when his last hour on earth <i>did</i>
come, it was so full of peace and holy confidence
in the Saviour of man, that she was assisted to
feel and say, &ldquo;Father, thy will be
done;&rdquo; and as she knelt by his bed-side to
receive his blessing, she felt conscious that
ministering angels were present, and gently
removing his spirit from earth to heaven.</p>

<h2><a name="SHELLS" id="SHELLS"></a>SHELLS.</h2>


<p>&ldquo;Well, Henry, where have you been? I have
not seen you this morning.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I have been with papa, and he has given me
this little box full of shells. Look, mamma, how
very pretty they are. Papa says they are found in
the sea, and that little fish live in them! Can
fish live in these very small ones, mamma?&rdquo;</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_154" id="Page_154">[Page&nbsp; 154]</a></span></p>

<p>&ldquo;Yes, my dear, a fish has lived in each of
these little shells. I have sometimes picked them
up on the beach with the fish in them; but they
are generally washed on shore when the sea is
rough, and the fish dies and falls out of the
shell before it is picked up; as fish, you know,
cannot live out of the water. Some day I will show
you a very beautiful shell, which I have in my
cabinet; it is the shell of the paper nautilus,
which is a very curious little fish. I have heard
that it was this fish which first gave men the
idea of building ships to sail on the sea. These
fish have two arms, or horns, which they put out
of their shells, and stretch a kind of skin across
them, which makes a little sail, just like the
sail of a ship. They then stretch two more arms
out of the shell, which they use as oars or
paddles; and when the sea is calm they amuse
themselves by sailing about on the water, and look
very pretty; but if a storm comes on, they draw in
their horns and their little sails, and sink to
the bottom.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Have you ever seen them sailing about,
mamma?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;No, Henry, I have not, because I have not
been much on the sea; but they are often seen by
sailors, who, you know, are almost always at sea.
There are a great many curious fish in the sea,
some very large indeed, and others very small;
about many of which I shall be happy to tell you
more at some future time.&rdquo;</p>

<h2><a name="EMULATION" id="EMULATION"></a>EMULATION.</h2>

<h3>A CONVERSATION BETWEEN HENRY AND HIS FATHER.</h3>


<p>&ldquo;What is the matter, Henry?&rdquo; asked Mr.
Carey of his son, who looked more sober than
usual, one day, after his return from school.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t feel happy,&rdquo; Henry
replied, looking up into his father&rsquo;s face
with an effort to smile. &ldquo;But I suppose it
is my own fault, although I can&rsquo;t help
it.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Has anything very particular
happened?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;No, sir. Nothing very particular. Only
I&rsquo;ve been next to head in my class for a
week.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Next to head! Why, I thought you had been
at the head of your class for the last three or
four months.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;So I have been until within a week. But,
since then, do all I can, Herbert Wellmore keeps
his place above me.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;And this is the reason of your
unhappiness?&rdquo;</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_156" id="Page_156">[Page&nbsp; 156]</a></span></p>

<p>&ldquo;Yes, sir.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;But do you think it is a just cause of
unhappiness?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I always feel bad if I am not first in
everything, father.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Do you think it right to feel so,
Henry?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Is it not right, father, for me to excel
others in every way?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yes, if it is in your power to do so; for
then you can be more useful than any one else.
But, it seems that Herbert Wellmore can excel
you&mdash;and I suppose he does so fairly.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Oh, yes. It is fair enough&mdash;and that is
just what I don&rsquo;t like. It shows that he can
do better than I can.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Then he will have it in his power to be
more useful to his fellow-men than you. And should
not this make you glad instead of
discontented?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I didn&rsquo;t think anything about that,
father.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;So I supposed&mdash;if you had so thought, you
would, probably, never have been willing to have
seen your school-fellow. But why does this
circumstance make you unhappy?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t like any one to get ahead of
me.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Why?&rdquo;</p>

<p>Henry tried to determine in his own mind the
reason, but was unable to do so. Mr. Carey saw
this, and added:</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_157" id="Page_157">[Page&nbsp; 157]</a></span></p>

<p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t you think that selfishness has
something to do with it? Wounded self-love, I have
before told you, is a frequent cause of our
unhappiness. Now, think again, and try if you
cannot determine the reason why you wished to
excel all others in your class.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;That I might be thought to be the smartest
boy in it, I suppose.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Would you not call that a mere selfish
feeling?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I suppose so. And yet ought I not to try
and keep ahead?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Certainly, as I have said before. But you
should not feel the slightest pain if another boy
excels you fairly. Suppose every boy were to be
disturbed in mind, as you have been, because other
boys were in advance;&mdash;don&rsquo;t you see that
every boy in a class, but one, would be unhappy?
And would that be right? None of us, my son, have
minds alike. This, you know, I have before
explained to you, and also the reason why it is
so. Now, do you remember that reason?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;It is because in society there are various
uses, all requiring a different order of talent.
Is not that the reason?&rdquo;</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_158" id="Page_158">[Page&nbsp; 158]</a></span></p>

<p>&ldquo;Yes, my son; that is the reason, and I am
glad you have remembered so correctly what I told
you a few days ago. From this you may see that
there is always something that one person will be
able to do better than another; and, of course,
one kind of knowledge that he will be able to
acquire more easily than another. Have you not,
yourself, noticed, that while one boy excels in
penmanship, another, who cannot learn to write
even a fair hand, will far outstrip this one in
arithmetic?&mdash;and a third go ahead of the other two
in acquiring a correct geographical knowledge?&mdash;A
fourth delights most in the study of navigation
and surveying, while a dull boy, in almost
everything else, can acquire a knowledge of
chemical laws more rapidly than any in his class.
You have, of course, observed all this?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Oh, yes, frequently. There is Thomas Wiley,
for instance, who, in spelling, reading, and
writing, is always behind every one else; and yet
no one can answer more questions in geography, or
project so beautiful a map, as he can. Charles Lee
has no trouble at all with the hardest question in
algebra; but is deficient in grammar, and hates
his Latin and Greek more than any punishment or
reprimand the teacher can give. And, now I think
of it, I don&rsquo;t know any two boys in school
who are alike in regard to learning their
lessons.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Do you not think that it would be very
foolish in Thomas Wiley to make himself unhappy
because he could not write so pretty a hand as you
do? Or for Charles Lee to forget all his skill at
solving algebraic problems, in making himself
miserable because he was behind another boy in
Latin and Greek, whose mind was peculiarly fitted
for the acquirement of language, while his was
not?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I certainly think it would, father.&rdquo;</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_159" id="Page_159">[Page&nbsp; 159]</a></span></p>

<p>&ldquo;Then bring this home to yourself. Is there
no one thing in which you can excel Herbert
Wellmore?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yes, sir. I can solve a problem in half the
time it takes him to do it in. But, then, he is
always correct&mdash;and so gets as much as I do from
the teacher, who does not seem to take into
account my superior quickness.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;In this, I need hardly point out to you, my
son, the selfish principle that influences you.
Instead of feeling grateful to your heavenly
Father for having given you the ability to work
out a difficult problem with half the labour it
costs another, you are unhappy because this
superior ability is not praised, and you, in
consequence, held up to view as deserving of more
commendation than Herbert; when, in fact, he is
the one who should be praised for his steady
perseverance in overcoming difficulties that are
as nothing to you.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I believe I have permitted myself to
indulge in wrong feelings,&rdquo; Henry said,
after remaining silent for a few moments.
&ldquo;But I think you have told me that emulation
is not to be condemned.&rdquo;</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_160" id="Page_160">[Page&nbsp; 160]</a></span></p>

<p>&ldquo;It certainly is not, my son. I would have
you, as now, emulous of superior acquirements;
but, at the same time, aware, that in this
emulation there would be no jealousy or unkind
feelings. Be first in everything, if
possible,&mdash;and yet willing to see others excel
you,&mdash;remembering, that in so excelling they will
have the power to be more useful to mankind; for
the true power that resides in knowledge is the
power of doing good.&rdquo;</p>

<h2><a name="THE_SHEPHERD_AND_THE_FAIRY" id="THE_SHEPHERD_AND_THE_FAIRY"></a>THE SHEPHERD AND THE FAIRY.</h2>


<p>A shepherd, who was of an unfortunately
discontented turn of mind,&mdash;one who was much
fonder of reclining lazily on a sunny bank, than
of viewing his own lot on its sunny side&mdash;was one
day moodily watching his flock, wishing himself
all the while its owner instead of guardian; in
other words, a happier man. His faithful dog lay
beside him, and every now and then licked the hand
of his master, as it hung listlessly by his side,
and then looked up into his face, as if to read
his thoughts. But the shepherd was in no humour to
stroke the shaggy hide of his friend, Keeper&mdash;his
envious musings having been diverted to the sleek
coat of his master&rsquo;s hunter, which had just
bounded, with its wealthy rider, over an adjacent
hedge. The sullen tender of flocks was all at once
roused from his reverie by the small, silvery
voice of a sprightly little fairy.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_162" id="Page_162">[Page&nbsp; 162]</a></span></p>

<p>&ldquo;What ails thee, my good man?&rdquo; said
she, tapping his shoulder with her wand;
&ldquo;you seem mighty melancholy. Have you met
with any disaster?&mdash;lost anything?&mdash;perhaps your
wife!&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;No such luck.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Or some of your sheep?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;What should I care&mdash;they&rsquo;re my
master&rsquo;s.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Your purse, then?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Purse!&rdquo; growled the shepherd,
&ldquo;no great loss, if I had, for it&rsquo;s
always empty.&rdquo;</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_163" id="Page_163">[Page&nbsp; 163]</a></span></p>

<p>&ldquo;Ah! I think I can guess what&rsquo;s the
matter,&rdquo; said the fairy: &ldquo;you are
wishing to be rich, and discontented because you
are poor. But, prithee, now listen to me. Once
upon a time, when we fairies used to mix much more
with mankind than we do at present, we learnt many
of their pernicious customs; and seeing the high
store they set by money, and the uses to which
they applied it, we (in an evil hour) resolved to
have money of our own. Nature had ready coined it
to our hands, in the gold and silver seeds of
flowers, and these we stored up, and made our
circulating medium. Then came amongst us, envy,
avarice, dishonesty. Instead of being, as
heretofore, the protectors of the beautiful
flowers, we became their ravagers; instead of the
most benevolent and happy little creatures in the
world, we became a discontented, malevolent, and
restless race. We began to dislike our native
dells and dingles, and to haunt, more than ever,
the habitations of man. We knew well enough,
however, that the cause of all our misery had been
our foolish imitation of their practices; and with
a view to revenge, many a sorry trick and
mischievous prank did we delight to play them&mdash;as,
doubtless, you may have often heard. This,
however, availed us nothing; and, at last, growing
tired of such profitless vengeance, we made up our
minds to return entirely to our shady recesses,
and, what was better, to our ancient habits.
Truly, it cost some of us not a little to part
with our stores of golden treasure; but at last we
all agreed to throw away our money; and having
then no further use for our purses, we hung them
up, as memorials of our folly, upon the
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_164" id="Page_164">[Page&nbsp; 164]</a></span>
most ugly
and worthless weeds we could discover, where you
may even now behold them.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The fairy, as she spoke, pointed out to the
shepherd some mean, ragged-looking plants which
grew beside him; and, sure enough, there he saw
suspended, the little triangular pods or purses,
of which she had been speaking.</p>

<p>They proved more useful to him than they had done
to their former possessors; for the common weed to
which they were attached, could never in future,
cross his path, without reminding him of the
lesson of his fairy monitress; taught by which, he
soon found that, in the enjoyment of a contented
mind, a light purse need not always make a heavy
heart.</p>


<div class="blockquot"><p><span class="smcap">Note.</span>&mdash;Shepherd&rsquo;s purse, or wedge-shaped treacle-mustard,
one of our commonest road-side weeds, varying greatly in the
size and form of its leaves. &ldquo;It flowers from spring to
the end of autumn, and ripens copiously its triangular pole or
pouches, whence its name,&mdash;distinguished from all other British
plants. The root is tapering, and exhales a peculiar scent when
pulled out of the ground. Small birds are fond of the seeds and
young flowers.&rdquo;&mdash;[<i>Sowerby&rsquo;s English Botany.</i> </p></div>

<h2><a name="SIMPLE_PLEASURES" id="SIMPLE_PLEASURES"></a>SIMPLE PLEASURES.</h2>


<p>Far, far down in the pass of the Clara mountains I
dwelt with my sister Joanna. We lived with an old
aunt, who took us home after our father&rsquo;s
death. She was not in good health, and so could
not do much for us. We were generally left to an
old woman, who had the charge of us; but she was a
little severe, and a little sharp, and very deaf;
so that we did not have many pleasant days with
her. Nevertheless, we tried to amuse ourselves as
well as we could. We had tamed a little rat, so
that when we laid a bit of sugar on the stone by
the stove, he would come out and eat it, while we
stood in the other corner of the room. It is true
that we dared scarcely breathe, but yet we were a
little flattered by his confidence in us.</p>

<p>Bits of sugar were, however, in these times, rare
treasures for us; and not more than two pieces a
week, could we have for the rat and for our own
eating. Sundays were great holidays for us, for
then we had Cologne water on the corners of our

<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_166" id="Page_166">[Page&nbsp; 166]</a></span>

handkerchiefs, butter to our potatoes at
breakfast, and roast meat at dinner.</p>

<p>It was also among our pleasures that we could,
twice in the week, walk an hour in the court-yard.
But, as people are seldom content with what they
have, we were not satisfied with our amusements;
and when summer arrived, and all the great people
came out to their estates in the country, we took
great pleasure in the idea of making a country
residence for ourselves. We had sometimes followed
the old woman to the cellar, and we had observed a
place in the corner, on which the light struck
from a certain air-hole, open towards the garden.
There we planted a pea, one fine morning towards
the end of May. For three weeks we went every day,
and sought out the place, removing the earth a
little about it, to see whether the pea had not
begun to sprout.</p>

<p>Our delight was great, when, on the twenty-fourth
day, after the planting, we saw a little swelling
up of the pea, beautifully green and very shy,
just peeping up with an expanded leaf.</p>

<p>We danced round it and sang for joy. Near this
plantation we then placed a little pasteboard
house, and before it a small bench, on which we
put some paper gentlemen and ladies. And no one
can have a livelier enjoyment in his country
residence than we had in ours.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_167" id="Page_167">[Page&nbsp; 167]</a></span></p>

<p>We lodged in a dark and very small room. But from
my bed I could see a little bit of sky in the
morning, and the chimney of our neighbour&rsquo;s
house. But when the smoke rose from the chimney,
and was coloured red and yellow by the rising sun,
under the dome of the blue sky, then I thought the
world up there in the air must be very beautiful,
and I longed to go thither.</p>

<p>I conceived a great desire to fly, and confided
this wish to Joanna. We made ourselves paper
wings, and as these could not lift us up, we tried
whether they would not at least sustain us, if we
let ourselves go, without holding on to anything,
from the stove, chest of drawers, or whatever we
had climbed up upon.</p>

<p>But besides that, we got many bruises in these
attempts, we made such a noise by falling to the
floor, that it brought in the old woman, who gave
a hearty scolding to the clumsy angels. Meanwhile,
we thought of still another means of sustaining
ourselves as we hovered over the earth. We
selected suitable sticks, which we used as stilts,
and on these we went round about the court yard,
imagining all the time that we were flying.</p>

<p>Would that we had been content with this! But the
desire to know more of the world without, threw us
into misfortune. The house which we lived in was
situated within a court-yard, and was separated
from the street by a high wooden fence. A part of
the enclosure was a garden, well fenced

<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_168" id="Page_168">[Page&nbsp; 168]</a></span>

in and belonged to a notary. He was a severe man,
and we were much afraid of him.</p>

<p>The temptation to evil came this time in the shape
of a little pig. We saw, one day, when we were
passing our play hour in the court-yard, a
fortunate pig, who was enjoying himself in the
most riotous manner in this garden. Spinach,
tulips, strawberries, and parsley, all were thrown
around him, as he dug with his snout in the earth.</p>

<p>Our anger at this was very great, and not less our
wonder how the pig could have got into the garden,
as the gate was shut and the fence was so firm. We
looked about carefully, and at last discovered a
hole, which had been nearly covered by a few old
boards placed against it, but which the little pig
had instinctively found out, and through which he
had forced his way.</p>

<p>We thought it of the greatest importance to get
the pig immediately out of the pleasure garden,
and we could see no other means of doing so than
to creep through, in at the same hole by which he
had made his way; and now we hunted with great
zeal our poor guide, and then put in order, as
well as we could, what he had scattered about.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_169" id="Page_169">[Page&nbsp; 169]</a></span></p>

<p>We closed the hole in the fence with a board, but
could not resist the desire to let it serve us,
now and then, as an entrance to this paradise. As
we did not mean to hurt, or even meddle with
anything in the garden, we thought it would not be
wrong to take a breath of fresh air now and then.
Every Sunday, in particular, we crept in by the
pig&rsquo;s hole, which we always closed carefully
after us. All around, within the garden fence,
there was a hedge of syringa bushes, which
hindered us from being seen from without.</p>

<p>However, it was very wrong in us to go into
another person&rsquo;s garden without leave; and
we soon found that every wrong thing brings its
punishment with it sooner or later.</p>

<p>There was a little summer house in the garden,
near that part of the fence which separated it
from the street. There were some bushes so near
that Joanna and I took the bold resolution to
climb up by them, so as to get on the roof of the
summer house, and there to look over the fence
into the street. Thought, said, done.</p>

<p>Proud, triumphant, and glad, we found ourselves,
after a quarter of an hour&rsquo;s labour, on the
much-promised roof, and richly were we repaid for
our trouble. We had a full view of the street. We
saw, now and then, an old woman with a milk-cart,
sometimes a gentleman in a chaise, and when we
were in great luck, a lady with a parasol; and,
still better, we had even a distinct perspective
of King street, and had the indescribable delight
of seeing a crowd of walkers and idlers, on
horseback and in carriages, passing by. The whole
world seemed to be moving there. After we had once
seen this, we could not live without seeing it
again.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_170" id="Page_170">[Page&nbsp; 170]</a></span></p>

<p>One day,&mdash;I remember it as if it were
yesterday,&mdash;one day we had taken our high post,
and were looking curiously upon the world in King
street. All at once we saw a stately rider on
horseback, and directly after him a pair of white
horses, drawing a splendid carriage. That must be
the queen!&mdash;perhaps the king himself! Out of our
senses with delight, we began to clap our hands
and hurra loudly. At the same moment we heard the
notary coughing in the garden. We were dreadfully
frightened. We wanted to get down quickly from the
roof, and hide ourselves among the trees; but, in
our alarm, we could not find the right places for
our hands and feet. Joanna rolled like a ball over
the notary&rsquo;s strawberry bed, and I remained
hanging by the chin to a great nail in the plank,
and screaming as if out of my senses. See! here is
the scar by the nail, it can be seen even now.&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<p>These youthful adventures were related to amuse
two little girls, who were suffering under a
disappointment, having been prevented from going
out to see an exhibition of fire-works. When their
governess had reached this point in her story, a
more than delicate supper was announced, and the
children ran off to enjoy it, without stopping to
inquire farther about the scar on the good
lady&rsquo;s chin.</p>

<h2><a name="THE_BABY-HOUSE" id="THE_BABY-HOUSE"></a>THE BABY-HOUSE.</h2>


<p>Are there any of you, my young friends, so young
or so ignorant as to believe that, if you might go
to the beautiful toy shops, and had but money
enough to buy just what toys you fancy, you should
be quite happy?</p>

<p>You have heard of Napoleon, the great Emperor of
France, and perhaps you have heard of his wife,
the lovely Empress Josephine. She had a daughter,
Hortense, who was married to the King of Holland,
Napoleon&rsquo;s brother. The Queen of Holland had
children, dearly beloved by their grandmother
Josephine. One year, as the Christmas holidays
approached, she sent for those artisans in Paris
who manufacture toys, and ordered toys to be made
expressly for her grandchildren, more beautiful
and more costly than any that were to be bought.
Her commands were obeyed&mdash;the toys arrived in
Holland at the right time, and on Christmas
morning were given to the children. For a little
while they were enchanted; they thought they
should never see enough of a

<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_175" id="Page_175">[Page&nbsp; 175]</a></span>

doll that could speak, wild beasts that could roar
and growl, and birds that could sing.</p>

<p>But, alas! after a few hours, they were tired of a
doll that could say nothing but ma&mdash;ma, pa&mdash;pa, of
beasts that growled in but one tone, and the birds
that sang the same note. Before evening the toys
were strewn over the floor, some broken, all
neglected and deserted; and the mother, on coming
into the apartment, found one of the little
princes crying at a window that overlooked a
court, where some poor children were merrily
playing.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Crying <i>to-day</i>, my son?&rdquo; she
exclaimed. &ldquo;Oh! what would dear grandmamma
say?&mdash;what are you crying for?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I want to go and play with those children
in that pretty dirt, mamma.&rdquo;</p>

<p>This story was brought to my mind last Christmas
eve. I went to see a very good neighbour of ours,
Mrs. Selby, a carpenter&rsquo;s wife. The whole
family are industrious and economical, and obliged
to be so, for Mr. Selby cannot always get work in
these times. He will not call them <i>hard</i> times.
&ldquo;It would be a shame to us,&rdquo; he says,
&ldquo;to call times hard when we never go hungry,
and have decent clothes to cover us, and have
health on our cheeks, and love in our
hearts.&rdquo;</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_176" id="Page_176">[Page&nbsp; 176]</a></span></p>

<p>And, sure enough, there was no look of hard times
there. The room was clean and warm. Mrs. Selby was
busy over her mending basket, putting a darn here,
a button in this place, and a hook and a eye
there, to have all in order for Christmas morning.
Her only son, Charles, was very busy with some of
his father&rsquo;s tools in one corner; not too
busy, though, to make his bow to me, and draw
forward the rocking-chair. I wish I could find as
good manners among our drawing-room children, as I
see at Mrs. Selby&rsquo;s. Sarah and Lucy, the two
girls, one eleven, the other ten years old, were
working away by the light of a single lamp, so
deeply engaged that they did not at first notice
my entrance. &ldquo;Where is little Nannie?&rdquo;
I asked. &ldquo;She is gone to bed&mdash;put out of the
way,&rdquo; replied Mrs. Selby. &ldquo;Oh,
mother!&rdquo; exclaimed the girls. &ldquo;Well,
then&mdash;have not you banished her?&rdquo;
&ldquo;Banished? No, mother&mdash;Oh! mother is only
teasing us;&rdquo; and they blushed and smiled.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Here is some mystery,&rdquo; said I;
&ldquo;what is it, Sarah?&rdquo; &ldquo;Mother may
tell if she pleases, ma&rsquo;am,&rdquo; said
Sarah. Mother was very happy to tell, for all
mothers like to tell good of their children.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_177" id="Page_177">[Page&nbsp; 177]</a></span></p>

<p>&ldquo;You know, ma&rsquo;am, the children all
doat on little Nannie, she is so much younger than
they&mdash;only five years old&mdash;and they had a desire
to have some very pretty Christmas gift for her;
but how could they, they said, with so little
money as they had to spend? They have, to be sure,
a little store. I make it a rule to give each a
penny at the end of the week, if I see them
improving in their weak point.&rdquo; &ldquo;Weak
point! what is that, Mrs. Selby?&rdquo;
&ldquo;Why, ma&rsquo;am, Charles is not always
punctual at school; so I promised him that if he
will not be one half minute behindhand for a week,
he shall have a penny. Sarah, who is a little head
over heels, gets one for making the beds and
dusting neatly. And Lucy&mdash;Lucy is a careless
child&mdash;for not getting a spot on her apron. On
counting up Charles had fifty-one pennies Sarah
forty-eight, and Lucy forty-nine.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;No, mother,&rdquo; said Lucy; &ldquo;Sarah
had forty-eight, and I forty-seven.&rdquo;
&ldquo;Ah, so it was; thank you, dear, for
correcting me.&rdquo; &ldquo;But Lucy would have
had just the same as I, only she lost one penny by
breaking a tea-cup, and it was such cold weather
it almost broke itself.&rdquo;</p>

<p>I looked with delight at these little girls, so
just and generous to one another. The mother
proceeded: &ldquo;Father makes it a rule, if they
have been good children, to give them two
shillings each, for holidays; so they had
seventy-five pennies a-piece.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Enough,&rdquo; said I, &ldquo;to make
little Miss Nannie a pretty respectable
present.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Ah, indeed, if it were all for Nannie?
but they gave a Christmas present to their father
and to me, and to each other, and to the poor
little lame child, next door; so that Nannie only
comes in for a sixth part. They set their wits to
work to contrive something more than their money
would buy, and
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_178" id="Page_178">[Page&nbsp; 178]</a></span>
they determined on making a
baby-house, which they were sure would please her
and give her many a pleasant hour when they were
gone to school. So there it stands in the corner
of the room. Take away the shawl, girls, and show
it to Miss &mdash;&mdash;. The shawl has been carefully kept
over it, to hide it from Nanny, that she may have
the pleasure of surprise to-morrow morning.&rdquo;
The shawl was removed, and if my little readers
have ever been to the theatre, and remember their
pleasure when the curtain was first drawn up, they
can imagine mine. The baby-house was three stories
high&mdash;that is, there were three rooms, one above
the other, made by placing three old wooden boxes
one on the other. Old, I call them, but so they
did not appear: their outsides had been well
scoured, then pasted over with paper, and the gum
arabic was put on the paper, and over that was
nicely scattered a coating of granite-coloured
smalt. The inside wall of the lower room, or
kitchen, was covered with white paper, to look
like fresh white wash; the parlour and chamber
walls were covered with very pretty hanging-paper,
given to the children by their friend, Miss
Laverty, the upholsterer. The kitchen floor was
spread with straw matting. Charles had made a very
nice dresser for one side, and a table and a seat
resembling a settee, for the other. The girls had
created something in the likeness of a woman, whom
they called a cook; the
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_179" id="Page_179">[Page&nbsp; 179]</a></span>
broom she held in one
hand,&mdash;they had made it admirably,&mdash;and the pail
in the other was Charles&rsquo; handy-work. A
stove, shovel and tongs, tea-kettle and skillet,
and dishes for the dresser they had spent money
for. They were determined, first, to get their
<i>necessaries</i>, Sarah said, (a wise little
house-wife,) if they went without everything else.
The kitchen furniture, smalt and gum arabic, had
cost them eighteen-pence&mdash;just half their joint
stock. &ldquo;Then how could you possibly furnish
your parlour and chamber so beautifully?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Oh, that is almost all our own work,
ma&rsquo;am. Charlie made the frames of the chairs
and sofas, and we stuffed and covered them.&rdquo;
&ldquo;But where did you get this very pretty
crimson cloth to cover them, and the materials for
your carpet and curtains?&rdquo; The parlour
carpet was made of dark cloth, with a centre piece
of flowers and birds, very neatly fashioned, and
sewed on. The chamber carpet was made of squares
of divers coloured cloth.</p>

<p>The cloth for the centre-table was neatly worked;
the window-curtains were strips of rich coloured
cotton sewed together; the colours matched the
colours of the carpet. To my question to Sarah,
where she had got all these pretty materials, she
replied, &ldquo;Oh, ma&rsquo;am, we did not buy
them with <i>money</i>, but we bought them and paid for
them with labour, father says.&rdquo;</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_180" id="Page_180">[Page&nbsp; 180]</a></span></p>

<p>These little girls were early beginning to learn
that truth in political economy, that all property
is produced and obtained by labour. &ldquo;Miss
Laverty, the upholsteress, works up stairs; we
picked hair for her, and she paid us in these
pieces.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;The centre-table, bedstead, and
chairs,&rdquo; said the mother, &ldquo;and the
wardrobe for the bed-chamber, Charlie made. The
bed-sheets, pillows, spreads, &amp;c., the girls made
from pieces <i>fished</i>, as they say, out of my
piece-basket. The work was all done in their play
hours; their working time is not theirs, and
therefore they could not give it away.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I see,&rdquo; said I, looking at some very
pretty pictures hanging around the parlour and
chamber walls, &ldquo;how these are arranged; they
seem cut out of old books, pasted against
pasteboard, and bound around with gilt paper; but
pray tell me how this little mamma doll was
bought, and the little baby in the cradle, and
this pretty tea-set, and the candle-sticks, and
the book-case and flower-vase on the centre-table,
and the parlour stove. Charlie could make none of
these things; you could not contrive them out of
Miss Laverty&rsquo;s pieces; and surely the three
sixpences left after your expenditure for the
kitchen, would go very little way towards paying
for them.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;To tell the truth, ma&rsquo;am,&rdquo; said
Mrs. Selby, &ldquo;the girls were at their
wits&rsquo; ends. Miss Laverty could not afford to
pay them money for their work. I had got almost as
much interested in fitting up the baby-house as
they, and would gladly have given them a little
more money, but I had not a

<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_181" id="Page_181">[Page&nbsp; 181]</a></span>

shilling to spare.
Sarah and Lucy laid their heads together one night
after they went to bed, and in the morning they
came to me and told me their plan.</p>

<p>&ldquo;We have always a pudding-pie on Sunday
instead of meat. &lsquo;Can&rsquo;t you,
mother,&rsquo; said they, &lsquo;reckon up what
our portion of the pie costs?&mdash;Make one just large
enough for you, and my father, and Nannie, and we
will eat dry bread, and then, with the money
saved, added to our three sixpences, we will get
what we can.&rsquo; At first I thought it rather
hard upon the children, but my husband and I
talked it over together, and we concluded, as it
was their own proposal, to let them do it. We
thought it might be teaching them, ma&rsquo;am, to
have love, as one may say, stronger than appetite,
and work their little self-denial up with their
love, and industry, and ingenuity. Poor people,
such as we, cannot do what rich people can, for
the education of their children. But there are
some things we can do, which rich people
can&rsquo;t&mdash;our poor circumstances help us. When
our children want to do a kindness, as in this
matter of the baby-house, they can&rsquo;t run to
father and mother, and get money to do it with;
they are obliged to think it out, and work it out,
as one may say: and I believe it is the great end
of education, ma&rsquo;am, to make mind, heart,
and hand work.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Again I looked at the baby-house, and with real

<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_182" id="Page_182">[Page&nbsp; 182]</a></span>

respect for the people who had furnished it. The
figures on the carpet, the gay curtains, tables,
chairs, &amp;c., were all very pretty, and very
suitably and neatly arranged, but they were
something more,&mdash;outward forms, into which
Charles, Sarah, and Lucy had breathed, a soul
instinct with love, kindheartedness, diligence,
and self-denial.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>Now, I ask my young friends to compare the gifts
of the poor carpenter&rsquo;s children to those of
the empress. Hers cost a single order, and a great
deal of money,&mdash;theirs, much labour and
forethought. If the happiness produced in the two
cases, to both giver and receiver, were
calculated, which would be the greatest amount?
And which, in reality, were the richest&mdash;the rich
empress&rsquo;s grandchildren, or the poor
carpenter&rsquo;s little family?</p>

<h2><a name="FIDELITY_AND_OBEDIENCE" id="FIDELITY_AND_OBEDIENCE"></a>FIDELITY AND OBEDIENCE.</h2>


<p>&ldquo;Isabelle: Isabelle! where are you?&rdquo;
but no Isabelle answered; and Mrs. Howard, her
mother, was just going to send some of the
servants after her, when Bruno, a large
Newfoundland dog, rushed into the hall, and caught
hold of her dress in his mouth. He was wet, and
seemed very anxious for her to follow him;
accordingly, Mrs. Howard called the gardener, and
followed Bruno, who seemed delighted.</p>

<p>There was a large pond at the foot of the garden,
and it was towards this that the dog ran; and as
they were proceeding along, a suspicion entered
the mother&rsquo;s mind, which caused her to hurry
forward; need I say that it was of her child she
thought&mdash;her darling Isabelle? Soon they reached
the pond, and there, on the bank, lay her
daughter; but her eyes were closed, and her cheeks
so white that she seemed dead. Mrs. Howard uttered
a shriek of mingled joy and anguish&mdash;joy, that she
was out of

<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_184" id="Page_184">[Page&nbsp; 184]</a></span>

the pond, and fear that she might not live.</p>

<p>She sprang forward and raised her from the
ground&mdash;she put her hand on her child&rsquo;s
heart&mdash;and, oh! happiness! she felt it beat.
Isabelle was immediately carried home, and a
physician was sent for, and he said that she was
not hurt in any way,&mdash;that fright, only, had
caused her to faint.</p>

<p>Bruno, the faithful Bruno, was given to Isabelle
for her playmate and protector; and often might
the two be seen bounding over the lawn, and
through the meadows; and when the little girl was
tired, Bruno would seat himself under the shade of
some tree, while Isabelle would make him her
pillow, and when she was rested, away they would
run again. But this was on holidays; for Isabelle
was a studious little girl, and did not spend all
her time in play.</p>

<p>I suppose my little readers are all this time
wondering why I do not tell them how Isabelle came
to fall into the pond: I must beg pardon for my
neglect, and repair the error by telling them.
Well, Isabelle had leave to play in the garden
with Bruno, and, as she was rambling by the pond,
she saw a beautiful tuft of blue violets; and as
she knew her mother was very fond of violets, she
wished very much to get them for her; and though
she had been told never to walk near the edge of
the banks, she thought she should be able to get
the flowers without danger; but in reaching for
them, her foot slipped, and she fell over into the

<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_185" id="Page_185">[Page&nbsp; 185]</a></span>

water.</p>

<p>Bruno immediately plunged in, and brought her safe
to the bank, as we have seen; but Isabelle learnt
a good lesson, which she never forgot, and that
was, obedience to her parents; for with obedience
to their commands, they will be always more
pleased and happy, than with the most lovely
flowers in the field.</p>

<h2><a name="BESSIE_LEE" id="BESSIE_LEE"></a>BESSIE LEE.</h2>


<p>In an old school-house in one of our rural
villages, one beautiful summer&rsquo;s day, a
group of merry children were assembled. Some were
hurrying with their lessons, while others were
turning listlessly from their books to gaze with
anxious faces upon the clock, which ticked loudly
(and very slowly on this particular day) in the
corner. An afternoon holiday had been promised,
and an excursion to a not far distant wood, for
the purpose of gathering berries. No wonder, then,
all looked pleased and happy.</p>

<p>At length, the long-wished-for hour arrived. A
waggon appeared at the door to convey the younger
children and the basket to the entrance of the
wood, and the elder scholars tripped gaily
on&mdash;each one with a well-filled basket in hand to
contribute to the repast &ldquo;under the
greenwood tree.&rdquo; It was not long ere they
reached the wood.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_187" id="Page_187">[Page&nbsp; 187]</a></span></p>

<p>&ldquo;Oh, how cool!&rdquo; one exclaimed, as the
breeze sighed through the trees and rustled the
green leaves; &ldquo;and how shady!&rdquo; another
cried, as she walked beneath the spreading
branches.</p>

<p>Near the entrance of the wood, meandered a clear
stream, and the soft, rich grass sloped gently to
the bank, while the branches of an old elm tree
fell partly on the water, and formed a fairy-like
nook; and here the children stopped,&mdash;&rsquo;twas
the very spot for their feast, before they
gathered their berries. The baskets were quickly
opened, and the contents spread upon the mossy
bank. But who was to do the honours of the table?
Their choice quickly fell upon a beautiful girl,
the daughter of the minister. Bessie Lee was
indeed beautiful; her golden hair clustered round
her face, and her eyes, of the colour of the
noonday sky, shaded by their dark lashes, gave an
unusually lovely expression to her countenance;</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">&ldquo;And her laugh, full of life, without any control,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">But the sweet one of gracefulness, rung from her soul.&rdquo;<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>No wonder, then, she was loved by all&mdash;rich and
poor, young and old. A wreath of wild flowers was
twined by the happy subjects, and the lovely queen
was crowned. And then they separated to gather the
berries, going in different directions, but
intending to meet by the spring ere they returned
home.</p>

<p>Bessie hurried eagerly on towards the interior of

<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_188" id="Page_188">[Page&nbsp; 188]</a></span>

the woods, but she went not alone; her cousin,
Harry Morton, about her own age, accompanied her
to help to fill her basket. Hand in hand they
wandered, ever and anon stopping to gather the
clustering berries, or the bright flowers, that
grew in their path. They heard the voices of their
companions, but soon the sound died away in the
distance. Yet they pressed on, conversing
gaily;&mdash;but the baskets were filled, and should
they not return, asked Harry of his cousin. She
looked up,&mdash;the sun was shedding his declining
rays through the trees, and the woods were flooded
with golden light.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I did not know it was so late,&rdquo;
exclaimed Bessie: &ldquo;we shall be missed, and
our schoolmates will be waiting by the spring; we
shall have to walk fast.&rdquo;</p>

<p>They turned to retrace their steps and hastened
on. &ldquo;Surely,&rdquo; said Henry, &ldquo;this
is not the way we came; the trees are closer
together, and I do not see the big chestnut we
said we would have for a landmark.&rdquo;
&ldquo;Oh,&rdquo; cried Bessie, &ldquo;that is
farther on; it was just where the two roads
met;&mdash;we shall soon be there&mdash;don&rsquo;t you
think so?&rdquo; The poor boy did not answer; he
felt that they had lost their way, and he feared
to tell his cousin, for timid as a fawn she had
always been.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_189" id="Page_189">[Page&nbsp; 189]</a></span></p>

<p>&ldquo;Are you tired, Bessie?&rdquo; He looked
into her face; the flush of hope had disappeared,
and her faltering steps could scarce support her.
He placed his arm around her slender waist;
&ldquo;Lean upon me, cousin; you are
fatigued.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Oh, Henry!&rdquo; she exclaimed, bursting
into tears; &ldquo;we are lost; and my poor
mother, how will she feel? We shall never see her
again; we shall have to stay in this dark place
all night&mdash;and the bears and lions&mdash;oh, what shall
we do?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Do not cry, dear cousin; there are no wild
animals here now; there is nothing to hurt us
here. The woods in this part are free; and
don&rsquo;t you know what we read this
morning,&mdash;there were no lions in this
country?&rdquo;</p>

<p>And so he tried to comfort her, and poor Bessie
dried her eyes and tried to smile. &ldquo;We are
like the &lsquo;Babes in the Wood,&rsquo; Harry;
only I am afraid there are no pretty robins who
will cover us up with leaves, and watch over
us.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The last rays of the sun faded away, and the
golden-fringed clouds melted into blue. The full
moon rose high in the heavens, and the bright
stars shone calmly down on the lost ones.
Exhausted, the cousins sank upon the grass, under
an old tree, whose friendly branches stretched far
and wide to shelter them.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I can go no farther,&rdquo; cried Bessie;
&ldquo;my head aches, and I feel so tired. Oh, if
I could only see mother,&mdash;she will be so
frightened. Do you think any one will come to find
us?&rdquo;</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_190" id="Page_190">[Page&nbsp; 190]</a></span></p>

<p>&ldquo;Do not feel so bad,&rdquo; said Henry;
&ldquo;nothing will hurt us. God will take care of
us, and it will soon be morning, and then we can
easily find our way out of the woods. Your father
will send some one for us, or he may come himself,
who knows?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Hark!&rdquo; cried Bessie, springing to her
feet; &ldquo;did you not hear a noise? Something
rustled in the grass; I am sure it was a
snake.&rdquo; She clung closer and closer to
Harry, and it was with difficulty he could soothe
her. He told her how groundless were her fears;
that a protecting Providence watched over them,
and they would not be harmed.</p>

<p>He wrapped her shawl closer around her, for the
night air was chilly to her tender frame.
&ldquo;The soft grass shall be your bed, Bessie,
and I will watch over you; but first let us say
our evening prayer, just as if we were at
home.&rdquo; Together the cousins knelt down and
offered their humble petition to the Most High,
and then they lay down on their mossy bed to
sleep,&mdash;Bessie, with her head pillowed on the
breast of Harry; his arm supported her, and so
they slept. Sweet visions of home haunted their
dreams, and their parents&rsquo; loved faces
smiled upon and blessed them.</p>

<p>It was morning; the sun was just rising, and a
faint light was diffused through the trees, and
the birds were carolling forth their matin songs.
Bessie still slept&mdash;the innocent sleep of
childhood. Henry lay in the same position, for he
would not disturb

<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_191" id="Page_191">[Page&nbsp; 191]</a></span>

her. For hours he had lain listening to every sound.</p>

<p>At length Bessie awoke; she looked
around,&mdash;&ldquo;Where am I?&rdquo; were the first
words that escaped her lips. She looked at Henry.
&ldquo;Oh! I remember now; we have been here all
night. Do you think we shall get home
to-day?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Oh, yes;&rdquo; said her cousin, gaily.
&ldquo;I am so glad you have rested so well. We
will soon set out, and perhaps we shall get home
to breakfast. But eat some of the berries, Bessie,
and then we will try to find our way out of the
wood.&rdquo;</p>

<p>She tasted the berries, but pushed them aside.
&ldquo;I cannot eat; I feel, Harry, if we do not
soon get home, I shall never eat again.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Oh! do not grieve so, dear, dear Bessie.
Look, the sun is shining brightly through the
trees; so <i>that is</i> east, and you know the woods
lie west of the school-house; so we will walk
towards the sun, and then we will soon see dear
home.&rdquo; He placed his arm carefully around
her, and they set out, her steps still faltering.</p>

<p>Mile after mile they thus walked, for they had
wandered far the preceding night. At times the
trees grew thinner, and they would congratulate
themselves they were almost home; but then again
they could hardly find their way through the
overgrown path.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_192" id="Page_192">[Page&nbsp; 192]</a></span></p>

<p>&ldquo;I cannot go much farther, Harry; for my
head throbs almost to bursting, and I am so dizzy,
I can hardly see.&rdquo; Bessie stopped and leaned
for support against a tree; her hat fell back and
revealed her face deadly pale. Poor Harry gazed
upon her in despair. What if she should die there
in the wood, away from all that loved her? The
thought was agony,&mdash;the scalding tears started to
his eyes. He took hold of her hand; &ldquo;Bessie,
speak to me; lean upon me&mdash;we will soon be home,
only think so.&rdquo;</p>

<p>At that instant, a plunge was heard in a
neighbouring bush. Bessie, too, heard it; it
recalled her fleeting senses. She looked up,&mdash;a
beautiful dog came bounding towards her. She
stretched out her arms; &ldquo;&rsquo;Tis Carlo;
dear, dear Carlo!&rdquo; The dog crouched at her
feet. She stooped to embrace the animal&mdash;the
tear-drops glistened in her eyes and fell warm
upon the faithful creature. &ldquo;Oh, Harry! he
has come to save us; we shall see home once
more.&rdquo;</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_199" id="Page_199">[Page&nbsp; 199]</a></span></p>

<p>But she was too weak to walk, and how was he to
bear her home? Delicately formed himself, and worn
out with fatigue and watching nearly the whole
night, he could scarce bear his own weight. Carlo
bounded gaily on, inviting them to follow. A voice
was heard in the distance, calling on their
names,&mdash;&ldquo;Bessie! Harry!&rdquo; He tried to
answer, but his voice was low and feeble.
&ldquo;Bessie, let me help you; I hear voices; let
us try to meet them; I will support you.&rdquo; He
raised her from the ground and tried to bear her
on. The voices approached nearer and nearer; again
he essayed to answer,&mdash;this time he was heard.
They saw some one coming rapidly towards them, and
recognised Bessie&rsquo;s father. He hurried on,
and received the almost insensible form of his
child in his arms. He was accompanied by some of
his neighbours, who supported Harry home. Scarce
half an hour elapsed, ere Bessie was laid in her
mother&rsquo;s arms. Carlo, half maddened with
joy, frisked and gambolled round them. In vain
poor Bessie tried to tell her story, but tears and
sobs choked her voice.</p>

<p>They had wandered very far into the woods. On the
return of their schoolmates without them, the
anxious father, accompanied by some kind
neighbours, had spent the night in search of them;
but had been unable to trace them, and returned
wearied and alone. Another party had immediately
formed, and the bereaved father had insisted on
again accompanying them. Carlo, Bessie&rsquo;s
little favourite, had followed, and it was the
instinct of the faithful animal that led the
father to his children. And now they were safe in
their own loved home; and many a fervent prayer of
thanksgiving for the recovery of the lost ones

<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_200" id="Page_200">[Page&nbsp; 200]</a></span>

ascended that night to heaven, from the humble
dwelling of Pastor Lee.</p>

<h2><a name="THE_STARS_ORION" id="THE_STARS_ORION"></a>THE STARS.&mdash;ORION.</h2>


<p>&ldquo;O Father,&rdquo; said Rollo, looking up;
&ldquo;look at the sky; see how full of stars it
is.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The sky was indeed very full of stars. The galaxy,
or the milky way, as it is sometimes called, was
very bright. Rollo looked at the stars a moment,
and then he got into the sleigh. His father
advised him to take a seat with him, behind; but
Rollo said he wanted to sit with Jonas, and see
the pond, when they came to it.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I am afraid you will be cold,&rdquo; said
his father.</p>

<p>&ldquo;No, sir,&rdquo; said Rollo; &ldquo;I
don&rsquo;t think it is cold.&rdquo;</p>

<p>So Rollo took his place, by the side of Jonas, on
the front seat, and they rode along. After going
at a brisk pace for a few miles, they came to the
top of a hill, where the pond first appeared in
sight. It looked like a great level field covered
with snow. They could see a dark line winding
along in a gently-serpentine direction across the
surface of it. Jonas said that this was the road
they were to take in crossing the

<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_201" id="Page_201">[Page&nbsp; 201]</a></span>

pond.</p>

<p>The horse went rapidly down the hill, and before
long they were upon the pond. There was not much
wind, but a light breeze blew keenly towards
Rollo&rsquo;s face, and made his nose and cheeks
cold. So he said he meant to turn round towards
his father.</p>

<p>His father proposed to him to come and sit upon
the back seat; but he said he should be warm upon
the front seat, if he only turned round. So he put
his feet over the seat, and enveloped them in the
buffalo skins which were down in front of the back
seat, and the buffalo skin which had been before
him, he threw over his shoulders, so that now he
had a very good place indeed. He could see, all
around him, the shores of the pond, with the
lights in the farm houses on the land, and all the
constellations which were spread out before him in
that quarter of the heavens at which he was
looking.</p>

<p>&ldquo;O father,&rdquo; said Rollo, &ldquo;I see
three stars all in a row. I wish I knew the names
of them. Could you look round and see,
father?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Why, not very well,&rdquo; said his father.
&ldquo;I cannot look round, I am so muffled
up.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Rollo, being seated on the front seat, with his
back to the horse, of course was looking at that
part of the sky which was behind the sleigh, so
that his father could not see the constellation in
that quarter of the heavens.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_202" id="Page_202">[Page&nbsp; 202]</a></span></p>

<p>&ldquo;Let me see,&rdquo; said his father;
&ldquo;we must be going nearly west, so that that
part of the sky is the eastern part. Orion must be
rising about this time. Perhaps the stars which
you see are the stars in the belt of Orion.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;In the belt of Orion?&rdquo; repeated
Rollo.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; said his father. &ldquo;The
most beautiful constellation in the sky is Orion;
and early in the winter it rises in the evening.
Orion was a hunter, and he has a belt: and in his
belt are three beautiful stars, all in a
row.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Well, father,&rdquo; said Rollo,
&ldquo;tell me some other stars that ought to be
near, if it is really the belt of Orion that I
see, and then I will tell you if they are
there.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Very well,&rdquo; said his father.
&ldquo;If they are the three stars in the belt of
Orion, they lie in a line one above the other, not
one by the side of the other. I mean by that,
that, if there was a line drawn through them, and
continued each way, it would be a line running up
and down in the sky, not a line extending from one
side to the other.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yes, sir,&rdquo; said Rollo; &ldquo;this
row of stars is in a line up and down.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;And off on each side of the little row of
stars are two other bright stars, on each
side.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;How far off, sir?&rdquo; said Rollo.</p>

<p>&ldquo;About twice as far, I should think, as the
little row of stars.&rdquo;</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_203" id="Page_203">[Page&nbsp; 203]</a></span></p>

<p>&ldquo;Yes, sir,&rdquo; said Rollo; &ldquo;I see
one of them. Yes, I see them both. One is on one
side, and the other is on the other side.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yes: then I have no doubt it is Orion that
you see. One of the stars that you last found is
in his foot, and the other is in his
shoulder.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I wish I could see his shape,&rdquo; said
Rollo, &ldquo;all drawn out in the sky.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;It would be very convenient, I have no
doubt,&rdquo; replied his father. &ldquo;Pretty
near the lowest of the three stars in the row,
there is a faint cluster of stars, towards the
south.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yes, sir,&rdquo; said Rollo; &ldquo;I see
them.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;They are in Orion&rsquo;s sword,&rdquo;
said his father.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I see them,&rdquo; said Rollo.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Now, look at all the stars in the
constellation again, and notice how they lie in
respect to each other, so that you will know the
constellation when you see it again.&rdquo;</p>

<h2><a name="THE_APPLE" id="THE_APPLE"></a>THE APPLE.</h2>


<p>Little Anna bent over a quiet brook, and smiled
with pleasure at what she saw there. A beautiful
living picture was reflected from the clear water.
There, bright clouds seemed to sail slowly along,
through the clear blue sky, and the leaves of the
trees seemed to flutter in the soft summer air. In
the midst of these pleasant appearances stood the
image of a beautiful little girl, with laughing
blue eyes and brown curled hair, which hung down
over her white frock, as she stooped forward, as
if to look back upon Anna, with a good-natured
smile.</p>

<p>While Anna was looking and wondering at the beauty
of this picture, an apple fell with a rush into
the water, and spattered her face with small
water-drops.</p>

<p>&ldquo;What is that?&rdquo; said she, wiping her
eye-lashes with her little hand. &ldquo;Oh, it is
an apple, covered with bright red cheeks. It is
swimming off down the brook, but I will see
whether I cannot stop it.&rdquo; She broke off a
blue iris, with a long stem, and

<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_205" id="Page_205">[Page&nbsp; 205]</a></span>

after trying many times, she at length drew the apple to the
shore, and taking it up with a smile, she turned
it round and round, to look at its red streaks.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Little apple!&rdquo; said she, with a soft
voice, &ldquo;little red striped apple. I should
never have dared to break you from the tree,
because the tree does not belong to my father, but
to good neighbour Ackerman; but a kind wind has
blown you down, into the brook, and now that I
have drawn you out with the flag blossom, would it
not be best for me to try whether you are as good
as you are pretty?&rdquo;</p>

<p>She sat down on the grass, under the tree, and
after she had wiped the apple, she ate it with a
very good relish.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_206" id="Page_206">[Page&nbsp; 206]</a></span></p>

<p>Before she had finished, another apple fell
directly into her lap. She wondered very much at
this last wind-fall, but was much pleased, and
thought it still more beautiful than the first.
Soon after, a twig fell into her lap, with three
apples upon it. Much astonished, she looked up to
the tree, and among the thick boughs she saw
little Fritz looking down upon her with roguish
eyes. He was a bright boy, but he loved mischief
better than work or study. He had gone to the
garden of neighbour Ackerman a little before Anna,
not to look into the brook, but to climb the tree
where the sweet red apples grew. He saw Anna
looking into the brook, and mischievously threw an
apple to disturb the water. He was very much
amused to observe Anna&rsquo;s surprise, and her
innocent belief that the wind had broken off the
apple, although it was a calm summer day, and no
air was stirring.</p>

<p>When Anna saw Fritz in the tree, she understood
what made the apples fall. She grew almost as red
as the apples, and cast down her eyes.</p>

<p>Fritz longed to talk with her, but did not know
how to begin. At length he said,&mdash;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Was it good, Anna?&rdquo;</p>

<p>Then he slid down the smooth stem of the tree and
stood close beside her, but he did not know how to
begin a conversation there, any better than he did
in the tree.</p>

<p>Suddenly, farmer Ackerman appeared from behind a
clump of bushes, and looked earnestly at them. He
was an old man, and was much loved and respected
by all his neighbours.</p>

<p>Anna and Fritz coloured and looked frightened.
They would have slipped away, but he called to
them,&mdash;</p>

<p>&ldquo;What disturbs you so, my little ones? What
must I understand from those eyes, which turn away
from mine, the sudden colour of your cheeks, and
these unquiet doubtful looks? Did you come under
my apple tree to enjoy the cool shade, or were you
enticed by the apples?</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_207" id="Page_207">[Page&nbsp; 207]</a></span></p>

<p>&ldquo;I am not surprised to see Fritz here, but
you, Anna, whom I have always considered so
innocent, how could you encourage this little
rogue to rob my tree, and receive the apples after
he had stole them?&rdquo;</p>

<p>Anna made no answer, but the tears rolled down her
cheeks, and her bosom swelled with grief. Fritz
could not bear the sight of her distress.</p>

<p>&ldquo;She has done nothing wrong,&rdquo; said he;
&ldquo;I am the only one to blame.&rdquo;</p>

<p>He then told the farmer how it had all happened,
and confessed his dishonest intentions in climbing
the tree. The farmer kindly said, &ldquo;A fault
confessed is half amended.&rdquo; He then wiped
little Anna&rsquo;s eyes, with the corner of her
apron, and gave her the handsomest apple he could
find on his tree. Anna thanked him, with a sobbing
voice and said, &ldquo;If I see another apple in
the brook, or in the road, I will not touch it
till I know whose it is, and how it came
there!&rdquo;</p>

<h2><a name="THE_BALLOON" id="THE_BALLOON"></a>THE BALLOON.</h2>


<p>&ldquo;Oh! brother, what is that?&rdquo; exclaimed
little Mary to her brother James.</p>

<p>&ldquo;What do you mean, sister?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Why, that thing, away up in the sky,&mdash;what
is it?&rdquo; And Mary pulled her brother by the
arm as she looked up at the strange-looking
object.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Oh, that thing so far up in the sky; well,
it is an odd looking creature. I wonder if it is a
bird; let us ask John the gardener; perhaps <i>he</i>
knows.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;John! John!&rdquo; cried both children at
once, &ldquo;what is that wonderful-looking
object, up there?&rdquo;</p>

<p>John looked up very wise, shook his head, and
looked again,&mdash;&ldquo;Oh! it is a
<i>balloon</i>.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Well, pray, sir, will you tell us what a
balloon is made of,&rdquo; said James, &ldquo;and
how it enables one to go up into the air so great
a distance?&rdquo;</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_216" id="Page_216">[Page&nbsp; 216]</a></span></p>

<p>&ldquo;The balloon is made of oiled silk, or of
silk prepared with a solution of India-rubber,
made perfectly air tight, and is filled with air,
lighter than the common air we breathe.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;But where can this air be obtained?&rdquo;
said James.</p>

<p>&ldquo;There are many ways of obtaining it, but
the easiest is to go to the gaslight company, and
purchase as many gallons as may be wanted to make
the balloon rise.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;This is, indeed, curious,&rdquo; said Mary;
&ldquo;I never thought air was bought and
sold.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;What is the <i>use</i> of a balloon?&rdquo;
asked James, who was very fond of asking questions
about everything.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know that it is of <i>any</i> use,
at present,&rdquo; replied John, &ldquo;but it may
possibly be made of use at some future
time.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I should like to go up in it,&rdquo; said
James; &ldquo;it must be so beautiful to sail
through the air, and look down on the cities and
villages, and green fields, and woods.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Oh, dear!&rdquo; cried Mary; &ldquo;<i>I</i>
should not like to go;&mdash;only think, we might fall
out.&rdquo;</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_217" id="Page_217">[Page&nbsp; 217]</a></span></p>

<p>&ldquo;Well, sister, I don&rsquo;t think there is
much chance of our ever trying it, though I should
not be afraid. But let us go and inquire further
about the matter, for it is certainly a very
wonderful affair. I dare say father will be able
to tell us a great deal more than John can, and we
may meet with some one who has been above the
clouds in one of these &aelig;rial cars or
baskets.&rdquo;</p>

<h2><a name="CURIOUS_LITTLE_PAINTERS" id="CURIOUS_LITTLE_PAINTERS"></a>CURIOUS LITTLE PAINTERS.</h2>


<p>The next afternoon, when Catherine found her
mother at leisure, she came and stood close by
her, and looked in her face for some time.</p>

<p>&ldquo;What are you looking at me for, so
steadily?&rdquo; said Mrs. Nelson.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I am trying to see the pictures in your
eyes, mother; and don&rsquo;t you remember, that
you said you would tell me more about these
curious little painters, as you call them? Is it
only that small dark spot in the middle of your
eye that sees?&rdquo;</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_218" id="Page_218">[Page&nbsp; 218]</a></span></p>

<p>&ldquo;That little place, my dear, is a sort of
window, which lets in the light that makes the
picture upon the back part of the eye. It is
called the <i>pupil</i>, and it is what is meant by
&lsquo;the apple,&rsquo; which you recollect being
puzzled with in the Psalm that you read for your
Sunday lesson. Do you remember it?&rdquo; After a
while, Catherine said, &ldquo;Oh, yes;&rdquo; and
repeated this verse, &ldquo;Keep me under the
apple of thine eye, hide me under the shadow of
thy wings.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;By this little round window the light
enters the eye, and passes through to the back
part of it, and represents there, upon what is
called the retina, everything that we see. So you
perceive that if anything happens to the pupil of
the eye, no light can enter it, and we should see
nothing of all this beautiful and glorious world
around us; we should be in perpetual
darkness.&rdquo;&mdash;&ldquo;And now, mother, I
understand the Psalm; for it is necessary that
these two little windows should be kept very safe,
as safe as we pray that God would keep us. But is
that a little hole in the eye, mother?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;No, my dear, this precious part of the eye
has a covering over it like the chrystal of a
watch; this is properly called the <i>cornea</i>, a
Latin word that means <i>like horn</i>, because it
resembles thin horn that the light can shine
through,&mdash;as you may ascertain by asking the cook
to show you a fish&rsquo;s eye, and looking at
this part.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;And is the eye all hollow, mother? or what
is between the pupil and the place on the back
part of the eye where the picture is painted, that
you called&mdash;I forget what you called it,
mother?&rdquo;</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_219" id="Page_219">[Page&nbsp; 219]</a></span></p>

<p>&ldquo;The <i>retina</i>, my dear, from a Latin word
that means anything by which another thing is
<i>held</i> or <i>retained</i>, as this part of the eye
holds or retains the picture of things. You ask me
what is between the pupil and the retina. There
are in the eye three different substances, called
humours, all transparent. A transparent substance
means anything that can be seen through. The first
one, directly back of the pupil, is called the
<i>acqueous</i>, from a Latin word, that means
<i>watery</i>: it is a thin liquid, like water. The
second, behind that, is called the <i>crystalline</i>
humour, from its clearness and brightness. It is
formed like the glasses they use in telescopes,
and is fastened at the edge by the delicate
transparent substance that covers it, called a
<i>membrane</i>. The one beyond this, and next the
retina, is called the <i>vitreous</i> humour, from its
resemblance to glass. All these substances assist
in forming the images of objects on the back of
the eye; but you are not old enough to understand
how, at present, my child.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Then, mother,&rdquo; said Catherine,
&ldquo;our eyes are as curious as
grandfather&rsquo;s telescope, or as the camera
obscura, that he gave us to see pictures
with.&rdquo;</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_220" id="Page_220">[Page&nbsp; 220]</a></span></p>

<p>&ldquo;They are far more curious my dear; and it
is by imitating the eye that they can make them so
well. I remember, Catherine, when your grandfather
sent that camera obscura to you the other day, and
your father showed you the pictures in it, that
you and Lucy and James capered about the room with
joy, saying, &lsquo;Oh, how good grandfather is to
give us such a beautiful thing!&rsquo;&mdash;and now,
my dear, when you go into a garden and dance with
joy at the sight of the flowers; when you look up
with so much wonder and delight at the beautiful
moon sailing through the clouds, and at the bright
twinkling stars; when, after having been even one
day away from your father and mother, you feel so
happy at looking in our faces, and reading in them
our love for you,&mdash;of whose goodness ought you to
think? Who has given you eyes to see all these
delightful things? Whom should you then love? Of
whom then should you speak, and say, &lsquo;Oh,
how good He is?&rsquo;&rdquo;</p>

<p>Catherine felt and understood what her mother
said, and answered her, that it was God.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I have yet much more, my dear,&rdquo; said
her mother, &ldquo;to tell you about the eyes,
that is very wonderful. This beautiful little
round window grows larger and smaller as you want
more or less light. When there is a great light,
it contracts so as to take in but little; and when
the light is faint, it becomes nearly twice as
large, so as to take in more.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Why, mother,&rdquo; said Catherine,
&ldquo;how can that be?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Shut the shutter,&rdquo; said Mrs. Nelson,
&ldquo;and then look in my eye.&rdquo; She did so;
and she saw the pupil of her mother&rsquo;s eye
grow larger and larger. &ldquo;Now open it,&rdquo;
said her mother. She did so, and it gradually
became smaller. &ldquo;Oh, it is very
curious,&rdquo; said Catherine. &ldquo;But,
mother, is not that pretty rim round the pupil of
any use?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;That is what it called the iris,&rdquo;
answered her mother, &ldquo;which is the latin
name for <i>rainbow</i>, I

<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_221" id="Page_221">[Page&nbsp; 221]</a></span>

suppose from some fancied
resemblance to it. It is thought that by means of
it the pupil of the eye is enlarged or contracted.
If you remember, my child, the pain you feel in
your eyes when you come from the dark suddenly
into the light, you will understand the use of
this, and see what a beautiful contrivance it is.
In the dark your pupils become very large, so as
to catch all the light they can. When the light
comes before they have time to grow smaller, they
take in more light than they can bear without
pain.</p>

<p>&ldquo;There is another thing that you never
thought of. You know that if your eyes were fixed
fast, as your ears and nose are, you could only
see straight forward, or you would have to keep
your head twirling about continually. But the eye
is set loose in the head, and surrounded with
little muscles, things with which we can turn it
up, or down, or in any way, just as we wish. You
know how long it takes grandfather to fix his
telescope; but our eyes are ready, quicker than we
think.</p>

<p>&ldquo;You perceive, my dear, that this beautiful
and curious thing, the eye, is very delicate, and
easily injured, and if anything destroys our
sight, it is a great calamity, and that the eye
ought to be carefully protected. And so you will
find that it is. It is placed in a deep socket,
surrounded by bone, and lined with something very
soft. It shelves over on the upper part, so as to
form the eye-bow,

<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_222" id="Page_222">[Page&nbsp; 222]</a></span>

which is a great protection to
it. It is important that it should be kept clear
and bright, and there is a little vessel close to
it, full of salt water, called tears, to wash it
clean, whenever we open or shut the eye; and there
is a little hole in the bone of the nose to carry
off the water after it has washed the eye. Then it
has a nice cover, which we call the eyelid, with a
beautiful fringe on the edge of it to shut the eye
up tight, away from the dust and air when we do
not want to use it: and which, moves so quick,
that it shuts up in an instant if anything touches
or alarms the eye. Indeed, it seems to be always
employed in watching over and protecting this
precious instrument of knowledge.</p>

<p>&ldquo;There is still another thing, my dear, to
be remembered about the eye. It is so made that
sight is pleasant to it. The blue sky, the green
grass, the flowers, the rainbow, all give it
pleasure.</p>

<p>&ldquo;A baby, you know, loves to look about,
though it knows nothing. Our Father in Heaven has
made it a great happiness to us merely to open our
eyes upon the beautiful world he has made.&rdquo;</p>

<p>After a short silence, Catherine said to her
mother, &ldquo;You told me that these curious
painters, as you call them, drew the pictures of
everything in that wonderful book that you
described. How is that done, mother?&rdquo;</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_223" id="Page_223">[Page&nbsp; 223]</a></span></p>

<p>&ldquo;All we know,&rdquo; answered Mrs. Nelson,
&ldquo;is, that the back part of the eye, where
the pictures are painted is connected with the
brain, and that by this means we become acquainted
with the appearance of things.&rdquo;</p>

<h2><a name="THE_UPAS_OR_POISON_TREE" id="THE_UPAS_OR_POISON_TREE"></a>THE UPAS, OR POISON TREE.</h2>


<p>This curious and wonderful tree is found in the
forests of Java; the gum which it yields is a rank
poison, and, indeed, so strong and powerful is the
poison of this tree, that the effluvia from it
prevents any tree, plant, or shrub, from growing
within ten or twelve miles of it. The country is
perfectly barren; not a living thing, or even a
blade of grass, is to be seen. The chiefs and
grandees of the country poison the points of their
arrows and daggers with the poison of this tree;
but as it is certain death to approach the tree,
the task of collecting the gum is given to people
who have committed some very wicked act, and are
condemned to suffer death. After sentence of death
has been passed on them, they are allowed to
choose whether they will be executed, or go to the
upas tree for a quantity of the gum.</p>

<p>&ldquo;If they were to ask me, mamma, I would go
to the tree.&rdquo;</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_225" id="Page_225">[Page&nbsp; 225]</a></span></p>

<p>&ldquo;Many of them do go, Henry; but I believe
not more than two out of twenty escape death.
Before the criminals commence their journey, they
are furnished with a box for the gum, a pair of
very thick leather gloves, and a kind of leather
cap, which is drawn over the face and reaches down
to the waist. They wear this cap to prevent them
as much as possible from inhaling the air, which,
as I mentioned before, is poisonous for some miles
round the tree; there are two glasses fixed in the
cap, to enable them to see without removing it;
they are usually accompanied by a priest for the
first three miles of their journey, who, when he
takes leave of them, blesses them, and informs
them in which direction they are to travel, and
also advises them to proceed as speedily as they
can, as that is the only chance they have of
saving their lives.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I should think, mamma, it would be much
better to do without poison, as it is only used to
kill people.&rdquo;</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_226" id="Page_226">[Page&nbsp; 226]</a></span></p>

<p>&ldquo;You are mistaken, Henry, in imagining that
poisons are only used for so bad a purpose. Some
of our most valuable medicines are poisons; but
mixed with other drugs, and properly administered,
they cure many painful diseases. Many poisonous
herbs are also used in dying different colours.
There is another poison tree, which grows in this
country; it is found in damp, marshy places, and
resembles the ash. It never grows very large. The
wood of this tree is poisonous, if you either
touch or smell it, but it is not fatal; the
effects of the poison go off in a day or two. If a
piece of the wood is put into the fire, the smell
of it will poison some persons, and cause them to
swell and itch all over, whilst others are not in
the least affected by it, and can even taste the
wood without being hurt by it. It is as cold as
ice to the feel, so that if you take up a piece
with a handful of other sticks, you would discover
it immediately. Little children should be very
careful never to pick or eat the berries of any
tree. I have often heard of little boys being very
ill, and even dying, from having eaten the berries
of trees growing in the hedges, mistaking them for
fruit.&rdquo;</p>

<h2><a name="DISOBEDIENCE_AND_ITS_CONSEQUENCES" id="DISOBEDIENCE_AND_ITS_CONSEQUENCES"></a>DISOBEDIENCE, AND ITS CONSEQUENCES.</h2>


<p>&ldquo;I want you to come over to our house, after
dinner, and play with me,&rdquo; said Alfred
Barlow, one Saturday morning, to a little fellow,
named Wilson Green. &ldquo;Father has just put us
up a swing. It is made with two ropes tied to a
limb of the great oak tree, and has a basket at
the bottom, big enough to hold two. And then we
have got a good many other things to play with.
Won&rsquo;t you ask your father to let you
come?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Oh, yes! And I&rsquo;ll come right away
after dinner,&rdquo; said Wilson, full of delight
at the thought of spending an afternoon with
Alfred.</p>

<p>When Wilson went home, he asked his father to let
him go over to Mr. Barlow&rsquo;s, and play with
Alfred. But his father told him that he did not
wish him to go there.</p>

<p>This was a sore disappointment to the little boy.
He did not ask his reason why he refused to let
him go; for this he knew would be of no use. But
he

<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_228" id="Page_228">[Page&nbsp; 228]</a></span>

was so very desirous of going, that he soon
began to think about disobedience.</p>

<p>&ldquo;He&rsquo;ll never know it,&rdquo; he said
to himself, as he saw his father leave the house.
&ldquo;He never comes home from the mill until
night, and I can be back long before that
time.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Something whispered to Wilson that to disobey his
father would be to do a very wicked thing; but he
quickly turned from the warning thought, and in a
little while determined that he would run over to
Alfred Barlow&rsquo;s for a short time.</p>

<p>Wrong as this was, Wilson so far forgot his duty
to his parents, as actually to go over to Mr.
Barlow&rsquo;s very soon after his father had gone
away. Instead, however, of spending the delightful
afternoon as he had anticipated, he found all the
family in much alarm for Alfred&rsquo;s little
sister, who had been taken very ill since morning.
Of course, all thoughts of play were banished from
the mind of Alfred, who loved little Anna very
much, and could not be persuaded to leave her
bed-side a moment.</p>

<p>As soon as Mrs. Barlow found Wilson in the chamber
of her sick child, she told him that he had better
run home, as the doctor feared that Anna had the
scarlet fever, and she did not wish any of her
neighbours&rsquo; children to be exposed to the
danger of taking it.</p>

<p>Slowly did Wilson Green leave the house in which
he promised himself so much delight, and turn his
steps homeward with no very happy feelings.

<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_229" id="Page_229">[Page&nbsp; 229]</a></span>

He had disobeyed his father, deliberately, and got
nothing for that disobedience but an exposure to a
terrible disease, of which he might die.</p>

<p>When his father came home at night, he felt almost
afraid to look at him in the face. It seemed as if
he must know all about what he had done.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Wilson, come here, my son;&rdquo; he said,
in a serious voice.</p>

<p>And Wilson went up to him with a sinking heart.</p>

<p>&ldquo;When I told you, at dinner time, that I did
not wish you to go and see Alfred Barlow,&rdquo;
the father began, &ldquo;I neglected to say, as a
reason for denying your request, that Doctor Ayres
had mentioned to me that little Anna was very
sick, with all the symptoms of a dangerous attack
of scarlet fever. This dreadful disease is thought
by many contagious, and it was for this reason
that I denied your request.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Wilson said nothing, but he was very unhappy. A
frank confession of his fault arose to his tongue;
but, before he could make it, his heart failed
him. Not that he dreaded his father&rsquo;s
displeasure so much as the distress his act of
disobedience would give him.</p>

<p>For more than an hour that night, did the unhappy
boy lie awake, after he had retired to bed, vainly
regretting his act of wickedness and folly. It is
said, &ldquo;of wickedness,&rdquo; for deliberate
acts of disobedience to parents are wicked. He was likewise

<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_230" id="Page_230">[Page&nbsp; 230]</a></span>

troubled, lest he, too, should be
attacked with scarlet fever, and die&mdash;and all
because he had not obeyed his father.</p>

<p>On the next day, when he learned that the doctor
had declared Anna Barlow&rsquo;s disease to be
really the scarlet fever, and her case a very bad
one, Wilson was more troubled than ever. How often
did he wish that he had been an obedient boy. But
no sorrow could recall the act.</p>

<p>It was several days afterwards, when the
boy&rsquo;s fears had nearly all subsided, that he
awoke one morning with a violent headache, a sore
throat, and a general uneasiness, with
considerable fever. The day afterwards, his skin
became dry and burning, and his throat so sore
that he could swallow only with great difficulty.
On the third day the physician pronounced the case
one of decided scarletina, or scarlet fever,
accompanied by some very alarming symptoms.</p>

<p>From that time for nearly two weeks the sick boy
was conscious of little more than great bodily
distress. When the fever at last gave way, he was
just upon the brink of the grave. The slightest
neglect on the part of those who attended him with
more than the care that a new-born infant
requires, would have proved fatal. But the skill
of his medical attendant, and the unwearying care
of his parents, were the means of saving his life.</p>

<p>About a week after the crisis of the disease had

<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_231" id="Page_231">[Page&nbsp; 231]</a></span>

passed, when Wilson could sit up in bed, supported
by pillows, as his father sat by him, he said, in
a penitent voice, while the tears came into his
eyes:</p>

<p>&ldquo;I have been a very wicked boy, father; and
that is the reason why I have been so sick.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;How so, my child?&rdquo; asked Mr. Green,
in surprise.</p>

<p>&ldquo;You remember having told me that I could
not go over to see Alfred Barlow, one day when I
asked you. Well, I wanted to go so bad, that I
disobeyed you. I found little Anna Barlow very
sick&mdash;so sick that Alfred could not play with me.
As soon as his mother saw me by Anna&rsquo;s bed,
she told me to go right away home at once. And so
I did, without having had any of the pleasure, to
gain which, I had done what you had told me not to
do. It was the scarlet fever that Anna had, and no
doubt I took it from her. But I have been severely
punished for what I did.&rdquo;</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_232" id="Page_232">[Page&nbsp; 232]</a></span></p>

<p>&ldquo;Severely, indeed, my dear boy!&rdquo; Mr.
Green said, wiping a tear that came to his eye.
&ldquo;But not too severely, if it prove the means
of restraining you from ever doing so wrong an act
in future. To disobey your parents, is to do
yourself one of the worst of injuries. For if, in
early years, you are not obedient to your parents,
you will not be truly obedient to just laws when
you grow up to be a man; nor, above all, obedient
to <span class="smcap">God</span>. And if not obedient to Him, you never can
be happy. It is not from any selfish desire to
command your obedience, that I forbid your doing
certain things at times. I have only your good at
heart. I know, much better than you can possibly
know, the evil that you ought to shun&mdash;and much
better than you can know, the good effects which
will be produced in your mind by obedience. But I
need not, I trust, say more now. You have had a
practical lesson that you can never forget, and
which will, I am sure, have upon you a most
salutary influence.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Indeed, father, I can never forget
it,&rdquo; Wilson replied, with much feeling.
&ldquo;No one knows how much I have suffered, in
mind as well as body, for my faults. From the hour
I disobeyed you until this moment, I have been
unhappy. And I believe, until I had told you all,
I should never again have been happy.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Repentance and confession are the only
means of obtaining peace after a wrong act,&rdquo;
the father said.</p>

<h2><a name="THE_GAME_OF_WEATHERCOCKS" id="THE_GAME_OF_WEATHERCOCKS"></a>THE GAME OF WEATHERCOCKS.</h2>


<p>The company arrange themselves, and give to the
four corners of the room, or the part of the park
where they are playing, the names of the four
cardinal points. To avoid disputes, it is best to
place the words east, west, north, south, in
writing, at the points agreed upon. One of the
players, and it should be a lively, gay person
accustomed to the game, takes the part of <span class="smcap">Eolus</span>.
All the other players arrange themselves in one or
more rows. When it is possible, a lady should have
a gentleman on each side, and a gentleman, a lady.
After having ordered silence, Eolus points to one
of the corners designated by name, it is no matter
which, and from which he means to have the wind
blow. When the god of the winds points one way,
the company must all turn in the opposite
direction.</p>

<p>It is a party of <span class="smcap">weathercocks</span>, and consequently
each one must turn his back upon the wind, to show
which way it blows. When Eolus cries

<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_234" id="Page_234">[Page&nbsp; 234]</a></span>

<i>south</i>, everybody faces north, and in the same way at all
the points. When he says <i>tempest</i>, everybody must
whirl round three times, and come back to the same
place. At the word <i>variable</i>, they must balance
them, first on one foot, then on the other, until
the god of the winds names one of the four points.
If he says <i>variable west</i>, then they vacillate
towards the east, but not rapidly, as most of the
motions of the game are made, for the wind is
changeable, and often, as soon as they have got
round to a certain point, Eolus gives a shout
which sends them all round to another.</p>

<p>When the capricious deity is pleased to name a
point directly opposite to the one where the
company is placed, they must all remain
motionless.</p>

<p>It may easily be imagined that this opposition of
order and motion, the variety, the multiplicity of
movements, must give occasion for forfeits to be
paid whenever a mistake is made. The game affords
a great deal of sport.</p>

<h2><a name="JAMES_CARTIER" id="JAMES_CARTIER"></a>JAMES CARTIER.</h2>

<h3>AN EARLY TRAVELLER IN AMERICA.</h3>


<p>James, or as he is commonly called, Jacques
Cartier, was the first who explored the shores of
Canada to any extent, and the first to discover
the existence of that great river, communicating
between the Atlantic Ocean and the great North
American lakes, the St. Lawrence. The Indians
called the river Hochelega, and told him that they
had never heard of any one who had reached its
source.</p>

<p>Cartier sailed up the river, and anchored his
vessels near the island of Orleans, below the
place where Quebec now stands. It was in the
summer of 1535, when he sailed up the river, and
he found Orleans island nearly covered with loaded
grape-vines, from which circumstance, as well as
from the beauty, variety, and luxuriance of its
vegetation, he named it

<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_236" id="Page_236">[Page&nbsp; 236]</a></span>

the Island of Bacchus.</p>

<p>All the early navigators to this continent were in
search of a north-west passage to India, by which
they thought they might reach the East Indian
islands by a shorter voyage than that in use. They
were formerly obliged to sail along the coast of
Africa, and around the Cape of Good Hope, when
they had still another, the Indian Ocean, to cross
before they reached China. This was a very long
and a very dangerous voyage, and they wished for a
shorter one; and the learned men of those days
were of opinion that there existed a passage
somewhere in North America, which joined the
Atlantic and Pacific Oceans together.</p>

<p>When Henry Hudson discovered the bay which bears
his name, he thought that he had found the desired
object, and Cartier indulged the same hopes, when
sailing up the noble river Hochelega, which he
called the St. Lawrence, because he had discovered
it on the day of the festival in honour of the
saint of that name, the 10th day of August. On the
15th, he discovered the island now known by the
name of Anticosti. At Bacchus island he was
visited by the principal chief of the neighbouring
tribes, whose name was Donnacona. The chief and
his attendants were very hospitable to the
navigators, and in a solemn assembly he welcomed
them, in the name of five hundred of his warriors,
to the shores of the Hochelega. Donnacona had his
residence and chief town at Stadacona,

<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_237" id="Page_237">[Page&nbsp; 237]</a></span>

which occupied part of the place where Quebec now stands.</p>

<p>Cartier had already made numerous and surprising
discoveries; but the great object of his
expedition had not been certainly attained,
although he had strong hopes of ultimate success.
Stadacona neither satisfied his curiosity, nor
limited his progress. The Indians informed him
that there was a town of much greater importance
farther up the river; but when he intimated his
intention of visiting it, they were displeased,
and resorted to every artifice to divert him from
his project. One of them was very curious. The
savages were themselves superstitious, and
imagined their visitors to be so likewise. They
dressed up three men in black masks and white
dog-skins, with their faces blackened and great
horns on their heads. They were put into a canoe,
with oars, in such a situation as to be carried
near the ships by the flowing of the tide. Their
appearance was awaited by the Indians, who lay
concealed in the woods. When the canoe neared the
ships, the white men were harangued by one of the
three ugly creatures, who stood up in the boat;
and as soon as they reached the land, they fell
down, as if dead, and were carried off by the
Indians into concealment. Some of the Indians
immediately came on board to Cartier, and,
feigning the greatest consternation, explained to
him the meaning of what he had seen. Their god had
sent these three

<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_238" id="Page_238">[Page&nbsp; 238]</a></span>

emissaries to signify that there
was so much ice and snow, in the far country, that
whoever ventured there would surely perish.</p>

<p>Notwithstanding their predictions, Cartier
determined to explore the river farther, and,
equipping two long-boats for the purpose, he
commenced his voyage. He was delighted with the
scenery on both sides of the river, and the
natives cheerfully furnished him with what they
could procure to supply his necessities. At Lake
St. Peter, the French were much perplexed by the
shallowness of the water, and their ignorance of
the channel. On the 2nd of October, 1535, Cartier
effected a landing, six miles from the town, below
the rapids of St. Mary&rsquo;s, which were
becoming difficult and dangerous. Here they were
met by more than a thousand of the natives, who
received them with every demonstration of joy and
hospitality, in return for which Cartier made them
many simple presents.</p>

<p>The next day, having engaged three Indians as
guides, Cartier, with a number of his own people,
entered for the first time the Indian village of
Hochelega, which stood on the site of the present
city of Montreal. Cartier remained among these
people for a short time, when the cold of a
Canadian winter began to approach, and he returned
in his boats to St. Croix, and afterwards to
France. He came again to Canada, in the course of
a few years, with Roberval, but did not stay long,
and returned to France, where he soon after died.

<h2>ANSELMO&rsquo;S ESCAPE;</h2>
<h3>OR, THE DOG SAINT BERNARD.</h3>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_240" id="Page_240">[Page&nbsp; 240]</a></span></p>

<p>In a beautiful valley in Switzerland there lived a
rich farmer, named Pierre, with his wife Mary, and
son Anselmo. When Pierre was very young, he had
been found, almost dead, in the snow, by one of
the monks of St. Bernard, and his dog; and he felt
so grateful that, now he was rich, he had sent to
the Convent of St. Bernard for one of those large
dogs which are so famous for saving people that
are lost in the snow; for Pierre was a good man,
and he wanted to have one of the dogs himself, so
as to be able to save any traveller who might have
lost his way. So one of the monks who had taken
care of him brought him a little puppy, and he
trained it so well, that even in the first year he
had brought home several travellers; but the first
life he saved was Pierre&rsquo;s own son, Anselmo.</p>

<p>The little fellow had been sent across the hill to
a distant village; it was a clear, frosty day, and
if he had minded what his mother had said, and
come home quickly, he might have been home long
before dark; but Anselmo did not think of
this;&mdash;now he stopped to make snow-balls, and roll
them before him, till they were larger and higher
than himself; then he would push them over the
rocks, and watch them, as they bounded from one
part to another, breaking to a thousand pieces on
their way; now he wandered from the path to follow
the track of an Izard, that perhaps had passed
hours before, and that he well knew would never
allow him to come within sight of it. And so the
time passed on, and when he ought to have been
there, he was not even half-way. When he did reach
the village, there were too many little boys ready
to play with him, for Anselmo to leave it soon; so
that it was already getting dark when he stood
alone on the top of one of the highest hills
between him and his home.

<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_241" id="Page_241">[Page&nbsp; 241]</a></span></p>

<p>The wind had begun to blow, and the snow was
drifting around him; he grew cold and frightened,
and at last sat down and burst into tears. Now,
for the first time, he thought of all his kind
mother had told him, and remembered that in
disobeying her, he had offended God. The longer
little Anselmo sat in the snow the more cold he
became, until at last he seemed to fall asleep&mdash;a
sleep from which he would never more awake, had
not God, from whom he had asked forgiveness for
his disobedience, watched over him in the hour of
danger.</p>

<p>Many hours before this, his mother had gone, again
and again, to look for his return, and now when
the wind began to blow, and the grey light of
evening come on, she trembled to think that her
child was alone on the hills, with snow on every
side.</p>

<p>Pierre had been away from home two days; he was to
return that night. And oh! how she feared it might
be to find Anselmo gone, his little boy lost to
him for ever; for she thought that if he should
miss the path in the drifting snow, he would never
find it again.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Here, St. Bernard,&rdquo; said she to the
dog, &ldquo;go and find Anselmo; go and seek for
my child, my brave dog!&rdquo; and she burst into
tears, and threw her arms round his neck. Well did
St. Bernard understand her words; he sprang from
her hold,

<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_242" id="Page_242">[Page&nbsp; 242]</a></span>

and darting through the door, was out
of sight in a moment.</p>

<p>The poor woman smiled. &ldquo;It will be a comfort
to him,&rdquo; she said, &ldquo;to see his good
dog, and will cheer his heart and give him
strength for the rest of the way.&rdquo; Poor
Mary! little did she think that already her boy
was stretched upon the snow, stiff and cold, and
almost without life.</p>

<p>An hour had passed; but neither Pierre, Anselmo,
or St. Bernard, had yet returned. Again and again
she wandered round the house and looked down the
path. At last a figure was seen, and as it came
nearer, she saw it was Pierre, and that he had his
child in his arms, and that St. Bernard was at his
side. &ldquo;Thank God! thank God!&rdquo; she
said; and she ran down the hill to meet them.
Anselmo is tired with his long walk, thought she,
and no wonder. Pierre must be tired too;
I&rsquo;ll carry the boy myself. But as she came
near, she stopped; for a sudden fear seemed to
have struck her, and she covered her face with her
hands.</p>

<p>&ldquo;He is not dead, Mary,&rdquo; shouted
Pierre; &ldquo;he is better already; see, he looks
up to you,&rdquo; and the child tried to raise his
hand, but it fell by his side.</p>

<p>Anselmo was laid in a warm bed&mdash;they rubbed his
hands and feet; and soon he began to revive, and
to look about him, and then to thank his father
and mother, and to tell them that he felt better.

<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_243" id="Page_243">[Page&nbsp; 243]</a></span></p>

<p>After Pierre and Mary had knelt by the bedside of
their child, and thanked God for his mercy in
restoring him to them, his mother for the first
time asked how it had all happened, and where he
had been found.</p>

<p>Anselmo turned his face away, and for a moment did
not answer; then he said: &ldquo;Mother had sent
me to the village, and I staid too long there; I
had played by the way too as I went. So it was
getting dark, and I lost my way, and was cold long
before I could reach home; so I sat down, meaning
to rest a little, and began to cry, but I do not
know anything after that. I think I remember
feeling very sleepy, and I suppose I did fall
asleep, but I do not know; my father can tell you
best, mother, for he found me.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;No,&rdquo; said Pierre, &ldquo;I did not
find you, my dear boy; I was close to the foot of
the hill, thinking that I should meet you all
well, and at home, when I saw something moving on
the snow; it stopped; and then I heard St.
Bernard&rsquo;s bark; it seemed wanting my help,
and I hastened up the hill. He was coming to meet
me, his head high in the air; his step through all
the drifting snow was firm and sure, and I saw
that he carried a child in his mouth; but when he
laid the child at my feet, I saw it was Anselmo,
my own son!&rdquo;</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_244" id="Page_244">[Page&nbsp; 244]</a></span></p>

<p>&ldquo;Then it was St. Bernard, good, kind, St.
Bernard,&rdquo; cried the boy, &ldquo;who carried
me all the way from the top of that high hill, for
I am quite sure it was there I sat down.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Whether this lesson cured the little boy of
<i>loitering</i> on his way, I cannot tell. I hope and
think it must have done so, but this I know, St.
Bernard became more than ever a favourite,&mdash;more
than ever loved and valued by the whole
neighbourhood, and he continued showing his
wonderful instinct and bravery, in many ways.</p>

<h2><a name="SECOND_STORY_OF_THE_SEA" id="SECOND_STORY_OF_THE_SEA"></a>SECOND STORY OF THE SEA.</h2>


<p>The tea-table was cleared away, the shutters were
closed, a bright wood fire blazed on the hearth,
and Captain Albert, with his family, were seated
round it.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Now, father,&rdquo; said Edward,
&ldquo;tell us another story of the sea, if you
please. How did you get your ship out of the
ice?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;It was brought out without much exertion of
mine,&rdquo; said his father. &ldquo;If you had
been there, my son, you would have felt that all
the power of man could have done little to relieve
us. The ice gathered around us thicker and closer,
the wind died away, and it was a dead, freezing
calm. The ship did not move an inch, and the
thoughts of my mind troubled me by continually
bringing up an account I had read in my youth, of
a vessel which had been caught in the ice near the south

<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_248" id="Page_248">[Page&nbsp; 248]</a></span>

pole and all the crew frozen, where they stood on duty&mdash;</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">&ldquo;To the cordage glued the sailor,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And the steersman to the helm!<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>&ldquo;I began to feel as if we had little
prospect of escaping a similar fate, and looked
about to see what part of the ship could be spared
for fuel, in case of necessity. I also examined
the provisions and water, and calculated how long
they would last. My faithful crew were sensible of
the danger we were in, but uttered no complaint.
The whales appeared to understand our helpless
condition, and came around us, as if in mockery,
dashing about the ice with their powerful flooks,
and exulting as it were, in showing us how much
more they could do for themselves than we could.
One of them even ventured to rub his monstrous
sides against our ship.</p>

<p>&ldquo;In this melancholy situation, Robert
(spoken of in our first story) was a valuable
addition to our ship&rsquo;s company. He was a
young man of bright natural talents, and possessed
a good share of wit and power of imitation.
Besides which, he had received an education much
superior to that of sailors generally. He was a
fine singer, and had a great share of good songs,
so that he became the life of the whole ship. We
had very little to do, and the men were very fond
of sitting down on the berth-deck,

<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_249" id="Page_249">[Page&nbsp; 249]</a></span>

among the hammocks, with a lantern in the centre, to hear
Robert give an account of himself, and relate the
wonderful adventures he had met with.</p>

<p>&ldquo;After we had been some time in the helpless
situation I have described, one morning, about
day-break, I was awakened from a troubled sleep by
the sound of a rushing wind, and rushing up, I
went on deck. A violent rain was falling, and the
wind was rising at the same time, which is a very
uncommon circumstance. It blew in a direction to
favour our escape; and think, my dear ones, what
was my joy and thankfulness, when I saw the ice
dividing before us, and leaving a broad, clear
path, as far as the eye could reach. The rain
loosened the ice from the sails, and it fell on
the deck in thin sheets; the sails filled, and we
began to move rapidly toward home. Did I not tell
you right, when I said Divine Providence helped us
out without much aid from us?</p>

<p>&ldquo;We had prepared to tow the schooner (to
which Robert belonged) behind us, but considering
that she would check the speed of our ship, and
feeling the necessity of making all possible haste
to escape from the regions of ice, I put three of
our most capable hands into her, with Robert, and
directed them to follow my ship as near as they
could. When we were in the open sea, it was a
pleasure to look back and see the little craft
clipping along through the waves, following on

<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_250" id="Page_250">[Page&nbsp; 250]</a></span>

like a greyhound in the chase, leaving ice and
icebergs far behind.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Our voyage home was prosperous and
pleasant. The remembrance of dangers and
sufferings, made every blessing more thankfully
acceptable, and I hope we all returned better and
wiser men.&rdquo;</p>

<h2><a name="THE_CHILD_AT_PRAYER" id="THE_CHILD_AT_PRAYER"></a>THE CHILD AT PRAYER.</h2>


<p>As the Lady of Lindorf entered the chapel, she
beheld a little girl, of about eight years old,
alone, and dressed entirely in black, kneeling
upon the steps of the altar. The child prayed so
fervently, that she paid no attention to what was
passing by her. Tears were streaming down her
blooming cheeks, and her beautiful and innocent
countenance had an expression of melancholy
resignation and pious fervor beyond description.</p>

<p>The lady felt the sincerest pity and greatest
good-will towards the praying child. She would not
disturb her in her devotions; and only when the
little girl arose did the lady approach
her:&mdash;&ldquo;You are very sorrowful, dear
child,&rdquo; she said softly; &ldquo;why do you
thus cry?&rdquo;</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_252" id="Page_252">[Page&nbsp; 252]</a></span></p>

<p>&ldquo;Alas!&rdquo; answered the child, and tears
flowed afresh down her cheeks; &ldquo;a year ago
this very day I lost my father, and this day last
week they buried my mother.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;And for what have you prayed to God?&rdquo;
asked the lady.</p>

<p>&ldquo;That he would take pity upon me,&rdquo;
answered the child; &ldquo;I have no refuge but
Him. True, I am still with the people with whom my
parents lodged, but I cannot stay there; the
master has told me again that I must go to-morrow.
I have a few relatives in the town, and wish very
much that one or the other would take charge of
me. The good priest, also, who often visited my
mother in her illness, and showed her a deal of
kindness, told them plainly that it was their duty
to do so, but they cannot agree among themselves
which of them is to take the care of bringing me
up: nor can I complain, for they have many
children, and nothing but what they earn by their
daily labour.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Poor child! it is no wonder that you are
sorrowful.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I came here very sorrowful,&rdquo; replied
the child; &ldquo;but God has suddenly removed all
grief from my heart. I now feel comforted. I have
no further anxiety than to live ever after His
will, so that He may take pleasure in me.&rdquo;</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_253" id="Page_253">[Page&nbsp; 253]</a></span></p>

<p>The words of that innocent child, and the
sincerity that appeared through her tearful eyes,
went to the heart of the noble lady. She looked at
her with the tenderness of a mother, and said
&ldquo;I think that God has heard your prayer,
dear little one; keep to your resolution&mdash;remain
ever pious and good, and be comforted, and you
will find help. Come with me.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The good child looked at the lady with
astonishment:&mdash;&ldquo;But where?&rdquo; asked she.
&ldquo;I must not; I must go home.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I know the good priest who you said had
been so kind to your mother,&rdquo; said the lady.
&ldquo;We will go to him, and I will arrange with
him how to help you.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Saying this, she took the child by the hand, who
went joyfully with her.</p>

<p>The excellent curate, a man rather advanced in
years, and of a venerable aspect, rose from his
writing-table on the approach of the lady. She
told him how she had just become acquainted with
the child; and then desired the little one to
leave her with the curate, and amuse herself in
the garden awhile, as she wished to speak to him
privately.</p>

<p>&ldquo;My dear sir,&rdquo; said she, &ldquo;I have
a great desire to take this child, and supply to
her the place of a mother. My own children all
died at a tender age, and my heart tells me that I
can love this little one. Still, I wished to know
whether you, who knew the parents well, would
advise me to do so. What do you say to it? I wish
to mark my short course on earth by some
benevolent action. Do you think that the benefits
I mean to bestow on that child will be well
conferred?&rdquo;</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_254" id="Page_254">[Page&nbsp; 254]</a></span></p>

<p>The good man lifted his eyes to heaven, and tears
of joy were glistening in them, as, folding his
hands, he said, &ldquo;The holy providence of God
be ever praised! You could not, lady, do a greater
act of mercy; neither could you easily find a more
pious, well-behaved, and intelligent child, than
the little Sophy. Both her parents were honest
people, and true Christians. They begun to give
this, their only one, a good education, but, alas!
they did not live to finish it. I shall never
forget with what grief the dying mother looked
upon this dearly beloved child, who was sobbing
upon her death-bed; with what confidence,
nevertheless, she looked towards heaven, and said;
&lsquo;Thou Father in heaven wilt also be a father
on earth, and wilt give my daughter another
mother: I know this, and die comforted.&rsquo; The
words of the good parent are now come to pass, and
it is obvious that the Divine Providence has
selected you, gracious and worthy lady, to be this
child&rsquo;s second mother: for this you were
called to this town&mdash;for this, God put it in your
mind to visit His temple before your departure. It
is evidently his work; let his holy providence be
gratefully acknowledged!&rdquo;</p>

<p>The worthy curate now called in the poor orphan,
and said, &ldquo;See, Sophy, this kind and devout
lady wishes to be thy mother:&mdash;this is a great
happiness that God bestows upon thee. Wilt thou go
with her, and be to her a good daughter?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; answered Sophy gladly, and
tears of joy prevented her saying more. She thanked her

<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_255" id="Page_255">[Page&nbsp; 255]</a></span>

benefactress with her looks, and
kissed her hand in silence.</p>

<p>&ldquo;See, my child,&rdquo; continued the curate,
&ldquo;how God cares for thee: when thy late
mother was lying on her death-bed He had already
conducted thy second mother here, unknown to us,
nor has He allowed her to depart without having
first found thee, and adopted thee. Know, in this,
His fatherly care;&mdash;love with all thy heart the
good and merciful God, who so evidently takes care
of thee&mdash;trust in him, and keep his commandments.
Be as good and obedient a child towards this thy
new mother, which He has given thee, as thou wast
towards thy mother which is now dead, and then
this kind lady will rejoice in thee, and thou
shalt prosper. One thing remember especially,&mdash;in
thy future life, sorrow and misfortune cannot be
kept entirely aloof; but when it does come, pray
with the same child-like trust with which thou
hast been taught; and as God has helped thee now,
he will help thee again.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The child&rsquo;s relatives were now summoned, and
made no sort of objection to the arrangement; on
the contrary, they were well pleased. Their
satisfaction was still more increased by the Lady
of Lindorf&rsquo;s declaring she would take Sophy
as she was, and leave her mother&rsquo;s little
legacy, together with her own clothes, to them and
to their children. Sophy only wished for a few
religious books

<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_256" id="Page_256">[Page&nbsp; 256]</a></span>

as a remembrance of her mother,
and these were willingly granted to her.</p>

<p>Early the next morning the Lady of Lindorf
departed for her castle, accompanied by Sophy.</p>

<h2><a name="THE_STORM" id="THE_STORM"></a>THE STORM.</h2>


<p>You have heard of Switzerland, my dear young
readers. You have heard of its high mountains&mdash;its
lovely streams&mdash;its pretty flowers&mdash;and bright
sunshine in summer. You have heard, too, of its
deep snows in winter&mdash;its frozen waters&mdash;and its
fearful storms;&mdash;its beautiful lakes&mdash;one moment
calm, soft and bright&mdash;the next changed into
furious commotion, throwing its angry waters high
into the air. There, many a little boat, that had
gone out upon its smooth waters, confident that
there could be no danger, has been lost, after
struggling long and fearlessly with the waves, and
sunk to rise no more.</p>

<p>One night I stood alone upon a high rock, which
projected over the Lake of Lucerne, and saw what I
have imperfectly described to you.</p>

<p>I had been on the mountains all day&mdash;a bright,
beautiful day. I had climbed the hills, where
nothing was to be seen but grey stone; I had
passed on to others, and found them covered with
lovely

<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_260" id="Page_260">[Page&nbsp; 260]</a></span>

flowers&mdash;growing in every spot where they
could find any soil&mdash;and some large trees, that,
spreading wide their branches, allowed me often to
sit down in the cool shade to watch the gay
butterflies around me, and to contemplate that
glorious and almighty Parent&mdash;the Creator of all
that is beautiful and good, and the Author of all
good feelings and affections, and who enables us
to enjoy all which He has made.</p>

<p>The sun was setting, and there was a bright red
glow over the lake, that lay like a large sheet of
glass, smooth and bright; and that was only
stirred when the trout leaped high in the air&mdash;as
if to look once more upon the sun before it went
to rest; and then sinking down, they left a bright
round ring on the lake, that soon passed away,
leaving all smooth again.</p>

<p>In a little time the waters began to move, and
there was a low sound of wind, that soon rose into
a storm; and then the waves dashed furiously
against the cliffs, as I have before described;
when a boat, with a man and a child, which I had
been watching for some time before, sailing gently
on the water, was now high on the crested
wave&mdash;now cast suddenly down; and each time I
feared it was lost. All I could do was, to pray to
Him, who could say to the wind, and the storm,
&ldquo;Be still!&rdquo; But their time had come,
and God saw it best to take this father and child
to Himself. I watched the boat till it came very
near,&mdash;so near

<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_261" id="Page_261">[Page&nbsp; 261]</a></span>

that I could see every stroke of
the oar&mdash;every look of the poor man, who seemed to
use all his force&mdash;but in vain.</p>

<p>The little child, who was seated in the bottom of
the boat, looked up into his father&rsquo;s face,
as if to learn there, what hope was left; but he
neither moved, nor uttered one cry of fear. At
last, when every chance of saving their lives was
past&mdash;when each moment brought them nearer and
nearer the fatal rock, on which it must be dashed
to pieces, the oars dropped from the
father&rsquo;s hand; and throwing his arms around
his child, in one moment they were gone below the
wave&mdash;and I saw them no more. They went down into
the deep waters together&mdash;and together they will
rise, I doubt not, to live in heaven with <i>their</i>
Saviour, and our Saviour for ever; for the man had
lived, as I afterwards learned, the life of a true
Christian, and was now removed, with his child, to
a state of existence where the &ldquo;wicked cease
from troubling, and the weary are at rest.&rdquo;</p>

<h2><a name="THE_MORNING_WALK" id="THE_MORNING_WALK"></a>THE MORNING WALK.</h2>


<p>&ldquo;Come, George! come, my little son,&rdquo;
said Mrs. Hope to her sleeping boy, one bright
morning in June, laying her hand upon him, and
endeavouring to awake him.</p>

<p>George roused up for a moment, and then fell off
again to sleep. He felt heavy and dull.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Come, George!&rdquo; urged his mother,
again disturbing him. &ldquo;Emily is up and
dressed for a walk. And the sun is up, too.&rdquo;</p>

<p>This time the little boy opened his eyes, rubbed
them, stretched himself, half arose from his
pillow and then sunk down again and went to sleep.</p>

<p>&ldquo;A little more sleep and a little more
slumber,&rdquo; said Mrs. Hope, smiling.
&ldquo;Ah, George! I&rsquo;m afraid you will be a
sad sluggard. Come! come! this will never
do!&rdquo; and she shook him harder than before.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_266" id="Page_266">[Page&nbsp; 266]</a></span></p>

<p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t you see, George, that your
sister is all dressed, and that the sun is
streaming in at the window?&rdquo; she continued,
as her boy started up quickly. &ldquo;Come, be
quick now, or every bright dew-drop will be kissed
from the leaves and blossoms before we can get
into the fields.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t care about going,
mother,&rdquo; replied George, sinking back upon
his pillow. &ldquo;You and Emily can go this time.
To-morrow morning I will go with you.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;And to-morrow morning you will feel just as
dull and sluggish as you do now. No, no, George;
now is the time. So, come, rouse yourself up, and
don&rsquo;t keep us waiting for you any
longer.&rdquo;</p>

<p>As the mother said this, she lifted her little boy
from his bed, and, seating him on her lap, first
of all washed his face in a basin of cool, clean
water. This made him as bright as a new shilling.
In a little while he was all ready for the walk;
and then mother, George, and Emily, accompanied
with gay little Fido, who went barking before
them, started off for their morning walk.</p>

<p>&ldquo;An&rsquo;t you glad, now, that you got up
to go with us, George?&rdquo; asked Emily, as they
tripped along, and drank in the pure morning air.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Oh, yes. I wouldn&rsquo;t be in that warm
bed, feeling as dull as I did, for anything.
I&rsquo;m so glad that mother made me get
up.&rdquo;</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_267" id="Page_267">[Page&nbsp; 267]</a></span></p>

<p>&ldquo;It was because I knew what was best for
you, my son, that I made you get up. I knew that
the fresh morning air would not only be good for
you, but that when you once breathed it, and
exercised in it, you would feel like a new
person.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Oh, see that beautiful butterfly!&rdquo;
Emily exclaimed, pausing near a sweet-briar bush,
upon one of the delicate blossoms of which reposed
a large butterfly, with wings glowing in colours
the richest and most varied, gently fanning the
pure air.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Shall I catch it, mother?&rdquo; eagerly
asked George, taking off his cap, and beginning to
move stealthily towards the sweet-briar bush.</p>

<p>&ldquo;No, my child,&rdquo; said Mrs. Hope, laying
her hand gently on the boy&rsquo;s arm, and
detaining him.</p>

<p>&ldquo;But, mother, it is such a beautiful one, I
should like to take it home and shew it to
father.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;And what do you think your father would
say, if you were to take him that gay
insect?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;He would call it very pretty, I am sure,
and say I was a good boy for bringing it to
him.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;No, George,&rdquo; replied his mother.
&ldquo;He would more probably say,&mdash;&lsquo;George,
my dear boy, I am grieved that you have crushed,
and soiled, and hurt this pretty creature. See,
how the beautiful colours have already faded from
its wings! See, how it droops in my hand, unable
to fly as it did a little while ago from flower to
flower, a gay and happy thing. You were wrong, my
dear boy, to have touched so delicate a creature,
born only for the sunshine and the flowers, and
too fragile to be handled by anything ruder than a
summer breeze.&rsquo;&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;But I won&rsquo;t hurt it, mother.&rdquo;</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_268" id="Page_268">[Page&nbsp; 268]</a></span></p>

<p>&ldquo;You could not possibly touch it, my dear,
without hurting the delicate thing. Your little
fingers, that to my hands are soft and smooth,
would be so rough to the wings of a butterfly, as
to rasp off the rich painting that adorns them,
and even to crush their delicate frame-work. And I
am sure my boy would not wish to hurt any of
God&rsquo;s creatures.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Oh, no, mother! I wouldn&rsquo;t hurt that
butterfly for the world. But see, it has risen up
from the flower, and now away it goes, floating
along like a pretty blossom with wings. And there
goes Fido, barking after it. Foolish dog! You
can&rsquo;t catch the pretty butterfly.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;See, mother, here is a bee, right in the
middle of this large flower,&rdquo; said George,
looking up into his mother&rsquo;s face with a
glow of pleasure upon his own. &ldquo;He is
getting honey, is he not?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yes, dear. The bee is a very industrious
little creature, and when the blossoms are out he
is up with the sun, and works all through the day,
busily engaged in procuring honey for his
winter&rsquo;s store. You never find him asleep
after the sun is risen, as my little boy was this
morning.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;But then, mother,&rdquo; said George, as
they all walked on, and left the bee and the
sweet-briar bush, &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t have to
gather honey as the bee does. I am a little boy,
and don&rsquo;t have to work to lay up bread in
the winter.&rdquo;</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_269" id="Page_269">[Page&nbsp; 269]</a></span></p>

<p>&ldquo;Can&rsquo;t you teach your brother a
better lesson than that, Emily?&rdquo; said Mrs.
Hope, turning to her little girl.
&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t you remember the talk we had
yesterday about the use of learning, and how
necessary it was for us, like the bee in spring
and summer, to lay up a store of knowledge in our
minds, against the winter of old age?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;O, yes, mother, I remember that I said,
just as George did just now, that it wasn&rsquo;t
as necessary for me to work as the bee, for I had
kind parents who provided everything for me. And
then you told me that I had been made very
different from the bee; that the bee had not a
mind as I had; and, therefore, that it only
required food to supply the natural wants of its
body, which food it industriously obtained and
stored up in the season when it could be found.
You then told me that I had a spiritual body as
well as a natural body, and that my spiritual body
required food as well as my natural body; that to
learn about everything that my parents and
teachers wished me to learn about, was the way to
store up food for this spiritual body, which would
require more and more food, the older I grew; and
that, at last, when I became very old&mdash;when the
winter of life came, I would not be able to store
up food as in early life, but would have to live
upon that already laid by.&rdquo;</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_270" id="Page_270">[Page&nbsp; 270]</a></span></p>

<p>By this time the mother and her children had
extended their morning walk as far as was
intended, and then they turned their steps towards
home. In passing the sweet-briar bush, the bee and
the butterfly were recalled to the minds of the
children; and George said, that whenever he passed
that bush he should remember that his fingers were
too rough for a butterfly&rsquo;s wings; and that,
like the bee, he must diligently store up food for
the mind, in early years, that he might have a
full supply when the winter of old age should come
upon him.</p>

<p>At the breakfast table they met their father, and
George told him all about what they had seen, and
what their mother had said to them, and how
determined he was to be like the diligent bee.</p>

</a>
</div>

<h2><a name="THE_OSTRICH" id="THE_OSTRICH"></a>THE OSTRICH</h2>


<p>There are many large and respectable birds;&mdash;the
long-legged stork, the crane, the bustard, the
heron, the eagle, the vulture, the cassowary; but
all these are mere dwarfs compared with the
<i>ostrich</i>. This bird is often nine or ten feet in
height, and is as remarkable for its great
strength and swiftness, as for its size. Neither
the swiftest horse nor fleetest hound can compete
with the ostrich in speed; but, fleet as the
whirlwind, he sweeps over the sandy wastes of
Africa. And this is indeed fortunate for him,
since, although a bird, he is unable to fly. He
has feathers only upon his wings and tail, the
rest of his body being covered with hair. The

<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_272" id="Page_272">[Page&nbsp; 272]</a></span>

ostrich has eyelashes upon the upper lid, and can,
like quadrupeds, see a thing with both eyes at
once; although other birds look sideways, and use
but one eye at a time. His bare, plump feet are
furnished with only two toes or claws; and his
stomach can digest the hardest substances,&mdash;wood,
stone, leather, metals, and glass.</p>

<p>It was imagined that the ostrich was a very stupid
bird, because, when pursued, it thrusts its head
into the nearest hole, apparently imagining that
when <i>he</i> sees nobody, he cannot himself be seen.
The fact, however, is, that when quite exhausted
by a long pursuit, it shields its head, because it
is the most tender and weakest part, and
surrenders the rest of the body to its pursuers.
Had the ostrich been in any way as stupid as the
goose, the race would long ago have been
extirpated, as it has many enemies both among men
and animals. It is, on the contrary, a very
prudent bird, and in a clear field extremely
difficult to catch, for it takes flight the moment
its quick sight threatens it with the slightest
danger; and as it lives in the deserts of Arabia
and Africa a few minutes is sufficient to carry it
beyond the sight of its pursuers.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_273" id="Page_273">[Page&nbsp; 273]</a></span></p>

<p>As the ostrich belongs to the same species as
fowls, it leads, as they do, a domestic life.
Every ostrich family consists of one male bird and
five females, who keep constantly together. These
birds have a common nest, which consists merely of
a hole in the sand, protected by a wall of sand.
Every egg stands upon its pointed end, in order to
take as little room as possible. When there are
from ten to twelve eggs in the nest, they begin to
sit upon them alternately, the female by day and
the male by night; as, from his superior strength,
he is better able to guard the nest from the
attack of the wild-cats, which are allured by the
eggs; and that he understands how to protect it,
is proved by the dead bodies of these animals
being found in the neighbourhood of the nests.
During the brooding, the female continues to lay
until the nest is full; and it generally contains
about thirty eggs. They also lay eggs on the
outside of the nest, with which to feed the young
ostriches, which, as soon as hatched, are as large
as full-grown fowls; and, like fowls, immediately
begin to eat greedily. The parent birds break one
egg after another, until the young are strong
enough to find their own food. The size of the egg
is in proportion to the size of the bird; it is as
large as a child&rsquo;s head, and yields as much
nourishment as four-and-twenty hen&rsquo;s eggs.
Four hungry men may make a good meal on one. The
shell is so extremely hard and close, that it
remains fresh for a

<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_274" id="Page_274">[Page&nbsp; 274]</a></span>

considerable time; and in the desert countries is a real treasure.</p>

<h2><a name="THE_VIOLET_MODESTY" id="THE_VIOLET_MODESTY"></a>THE VIOLET.&mdash;MODESTY.</h2>


<p>The fragrance of the violet is noticed when the
flower itself is not seen&mdash;just as benevolent
persons&rsquo; actions are sometimes known and
felt, while the <i>actors</i> remain out of sight.</p>

<p>Four hundred years ago, some gentlemen of rank,
who were very fond of poetry, were walking at
Toulouse; one of them remarking the beauty of the
violet, all agreed to write some verses on it, as
a sort of trial of skill. At the end of the week,
the poets met, and each read the verses he had
written, and the umpire decided which of the poems
was the best. Wishing to extend a love of poetry,
those gentlemen, with some others, drew up a
circular letter in rhyme, and addressed it to all
the poets of Languedoc, inviting them to come to
Toulouse on the first of May, and read their
verses, promising a golden violet to him who
should compose the best poem. This society
continued until the middle of the last century,
when it became more celebrated from an incident
connected with

<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_275" id="Page_275">[Page&nbsp; 275]</a></span>

Marmontel, the French poet. He was
the child of very poor parents, but being very
fond of study, he gave his life up to it. After
contending with great difficulties, he obtained
admittance into a college, and hearing of this
annual challenge, resolved to enter the list of
the Toulousian writers. He was very fond of his
mother, and, for <i>her</i> sake, more than anything
else, he determined to obtain the prize of the
golden violet.</p>

<p>The hall was filled with the gentry, and the young
students of the university were present. When the
successful candidate was announced, the hall
resounded with the sounds of music and the shouts
of the audience.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_276" id="Page_276">[Page&nbsp; 276]</a></span></p>

<p>Marmontel had been kept in great suspense during
the time of the decision by the judges. It was
first announced that the prize for the ode had
been withheld; and as he had offered an ode to the
academy, and had been the author of an
unsuccessful idyll, everybody pitied the youth for
his disappointment. But when the poem which gained
the prize was proclaimed, Marmontel stood up and
received it. Some were glad of this, and said,
&ldquo;Poor fellow, he missed twice&mdash;but he did
not fail a third time; he has more than one string
or arrow to <i>his</i> bow.&rdquo; He retired to his
seat, but only to be called up the second time for
the second prize; again he retired, and again
returned to receive the other prize, amid the
redoubled and enthusiastic applause of the
multitude. But, in the midst of this applause, the
young poet looked around among the vast multitude,
and there he beheld two arms stretched out to
receive him; they were those of his tutor. Close
beside stood his mother, shedding tears of joy. He
rushed forward through the crowd,&mdash;&ldquo;My
father!&rdquo; said he, &ldquo;my mother!&mdash;take
them all,&mdash;they are yours;&rdquo; and so saying,
he threw all the prizes, together with himself,
into the arms extended to receive him.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Ah! my children;&rdquo; said he, when he
became an old man, &ldquo;that which interests the
heart is always sweet. I care nothing for the
golden violet now. But the feelings of love which
burned in my heart for my mother and good old
tutor, are as fresh as ever, and survive the
blight of other things, as the fragrance of the
violet survives its withered leaf.&rdquo;</p>

<h2><a name="THE_ELEPHANT" id="THE_ELEPHANT"></a>THE ELEPHANT.</h2>


<p>The elephant is by far the largest and strongest
quadruped in the world. He is capable of carrying
a burden of several thousand pounds&rsquo; weight;
and when tamed, one of the most sagacious and
teachable of all animals. He is of great service
to Eastern nations, particularly in time of war. A
sort of turret is fastened on his back, in which
are men with their fire-arms. His amazing strength
renders him a fearful enemy.</p>

<p>It is related, that, by some accident, a large
cannon had fallen into a ravine, where it stuck
fast. An elephant was taken to the spot to draw it
out; but he shook his head and gave evident signs
that

<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_278" id="Page_278">[Page&nbsp; 278]</a></span>

he thought it beyond his strength. His
keeper, however, fastened him to the cannon, and
he tried, but in vain, to pull it up, and was sent
away. But, as there appeared no other way of
getting the cannon out, the elephant was again
fastened to it; he showed symptoms of displeasure
at being required to do what was beyond his power,
but when urged forward by his keeper, he strained
with all his might, and pulled the cannon out of
the ravine and dropped down dead.</p>

Updated editions will replace the previous one--the old editions

Creating the works from public domain print editions means that no
one owns a United States copyright in these works, so the Foundation
(and you!) can copy and distribute it in the United States without
permission and without paying copyright royalties.  Special rules,
set forth in the General Terms of Use part of this license, apply to
copying and distributing Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works to
protect the PROJECT GUTENBERG-tm concept and trademark.  Project
Gutenberg is a registered trademark, and may not be used if you
charge for the eBooks, unless you receive specific permission.  If you
do not charge anything for copies of this eBook, complying with the
rules is very easy.  You may use this eBook for nearly any purpose
such as creation of derivative works, reports, performances and
research.  They may be modified and printed and given away--you may do
practically ANYTHING with public domain eBooks.  Redistribution is
subject to the trademark license, especially commercial
redistribution.



*** START: FULL LICENSE ***

THE FULL PROJECT GUTENBERG LICENSE
PLEASE READ THIS BEFORE YOU DISTRIBUTE OR USE THIS WORK

To protect the Project Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting the free
distribution of electronic works, by using or distributing this work
(or any other work associated in any way with the phrase "Project
Gutenberg"), you agree to comply with all the terms of the Full Project
Gutenberg-tm License (available with this file or online at
http://gutenberg.org/license).


Section 1.  General Terms of Use and Redistributing Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works

1.A.  By reading or using any part of this Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic work, you indicate that you have read, understand, agree to
and accept all the terms of this license and intellectual property
(trademark/copyright) agreement.  If you do not agree to abide by all
the terms of this agreement, you must cease using and return or destroy
all copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in your possession.
If you paid a fee for obtaining a copy of or access to a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work and you do not agree to be bound by the
terms of this agreement, you may obtain a refund from the person or
entity to whom you paid the fee as set forth in paragraph 1.E.8.

1.B.  "Project Gutenberg" is a registered trademark.  It may only be
used on or associated in any way with an electronic work by people who
agree to be bound by the terms of this agreement.  There are a few
things that you can do with most Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works
even without complying with the full terms of this agreement.  See
paragraph 1.C below.  There are a lot of things you can do with Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works if you follow the terms of this agreement
and help preserve free future access to Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.  See paragraph 1.E below.

1.C.  The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation ("the Foundation"
or PGLAF), owns a compilation copyright in the collection of Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works.  Nearly all the individual works in the
collection are in the public domain in the United States.  If an
individual work is in the public domain in the United States and you are
located in the United States, we do not claim a right to prevent you from
copying, distributing, performing, displaying or creating derivative
works based on the work as long as all references to Project Gutenberg
are removed.  Of course, we hope that you will support the Project
Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting free access to electronic works by
freely sharing Project Gutenberg-tm works in compliance with the terms of
this agreement for keeping the Project Gutenberg-tm name associated with
the work.  You can easily comply with the terms of this agreement by
keeping this work in the same format with its attached full Project
Gutenberg-tm License when you share it without charge with others.

1.D.  The copyright laws of the place where you are located also govern
what you can do with this work.  Copyright laws in most countries are in
a constant state of change.  If you are outside the United States, check
the laws of your country in addition to the terms of this agreement
before downloading, copying, displaying, performing, distributing or
creating derivative works based on this work or any other Project
Gutenberg-tm work.  The Foundation makes no representations concerning
the copyright status of any work in any country outside the United
States.

1.E.  Unless you have removed all references to Project Gutenberg:

1.E.1.  The following sentence, with active links to, or other immediate
access to, the full Project Gutenberg-tm License must appear prominently
whenever any copy of a Project Gutenberg-tm work (any work on which the

Gutenberg" is associated) is accessed, displayed, performed, viewed,
copied or distributed:

This eBook is for the use of anyone anywhere at no cost and with
almost no restrictions whatsoever.  You may copy it, give it away or
re-use it under the terms of the Project Gutenberg License included
with this eBook or online at www.gutenberg.org

1.E.2.  If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is derived
from the public domain (does not contain a notice indicating that it is
posted with permission of the copyright holder), the work can be copied
and distributed to anyone in the United States without paying any fees
or charges.  If you are redistributing or providing access to a work
with the phrase "Project Gutenberg" associated with or appearing on the
work, you must comply either with the requirements of paragraphs 1.E.1
through 1.E.7 or obtain permission for the use of the work and the
Project Gutenberg-tm trademark as set forth in paragraphs 1.E.8 or
1.E.9.

1.E.3.  If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is posted
with the permission of the copyright holder, your use and distribution
must comply with both paragraphs 1.E.1 through 1.E.7 and any additional
terms imposed by the copyright holder.  Additional terms will be linked
to the Project Gutenberg-tm License for all works posted with the
permission of the copyright holder found at the beginning of this work.

1.E.4.  Do not unlink or detach or remove the full Project Gutenberg-tm
License terms from this work, or any files containing a part of this
work or any other work associated with Project Gutenberg-tm.

1.E.5.  Do not copy, display, perform, distribute or redistribute this
electronic work, or any part of this electronic work, without
prominently displaying the sentence set forth in paragraph 1.E.1 with
active links or immediate access to the full terms of the Project
Gutenberg-tm License.

1.E.6.  You may convert to and distribute this work in any binary,
compressed, marked up, nonproprietary or proprietary form, including any
word processing or hypertext form.  However, if you provide access to or
distribute copies of a Project Gutenberg-tm work in a format other than
"Plain Vanilla ASCII" or other format used in the official version
posted on the official Project Gutenberg-tm web site (www.gutenberg.org),
you must, at no additional cost, fee or expense to the user, provide a
copy, a means of exporting a copy, or a means of obtaining a copy upon
request, of the work in its original "Plain Vanilla ASCII" or other
form.  Any alternate format must include the full Project Gutenberg-tm
License as specified in paragraph 1.E.1.

1.E.7.  Do not charge a fee for access to, viewing, displaying,
performing, copying or distributing any Project Gutenberg-tm works
unless you comply with paragraph 1.E.8 or 1.E.9.

access to or distributing Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works provided
that

- You pay a royalty fee of 20% of the gross profits you derive from
     the use of Project Gutenberg-tm works calculated using the method
     you already use to calculate your applicable taxes.  The fee is
     owed to the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm trademark, but he
     has agreed to donate royalties under this paragraph to the
     Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation.  Royalty payments
     must be paid within 60 days following each date on which you
     prepare (or are legally required to prepare) your periodic tax
     returns.  Royalty payments should be clearly marked as such and
     sent to the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation at the
     address specified in Section 4, "Information about donations to
     the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation."

- You provide a full refund of any money paid by a user who notifies
     you in writing (or by e-mail) within 30 days of receipt that s/he
     does not agree to the terms of the full Project Gutenberg-tm
     License.  You must require such a user to return or
     destroy all copies of the works possessed in a physical medium
     and discontinue all use of and all access to other copies of
     Project Gutenberg-tm works.

- You provide, in accordance with paragraph 1.F.3, a full refund of any
     money paid for a work or a replacement copy, if a defect in the
     electronic work is discovered and reported to you within 90 days
     of receipt of the work.

- You comply with all other terms of this agreement for free
     distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm works.

1.E.9.  If you wish to charge a fee or distribute a Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic work or group of works on different terms than are set
forth in this agreement, you must obtain permission in writing from
both the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation and Michael
Hart, the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm trademark.  Contact the
Foundation as set forth in Section 3 below.

1.F.

1.F.1.  Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
public domain works in creating the Project Gutenberg-tm
collection.  Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may contain
"Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate or
corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other intellectual
property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or other medium, a
computer virus, or computer codes that damage or cannot be read by
your equipment.

1.F.2.  LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the "Right
of Replacement or Refund" described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project
Gutenberg-tm trademark, and any other party distributing a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work under this agreement, disclaim all
liability to you for damages, costs and expenses, including legal
fees.  YOU AGREE THAT YOU HAVE NO REMEDIES FOR NEGLIGENCE, STRICT
LIABILITY, BREACH OF WARRANTY OR BREACH OF CONTRACT EXCEPT THOSE
PROVIDED IN PARAGRAPH 1.F.3. YOU AGREE THAT THE FOUNDATION, THE
TRADEMARK OWNER, AND ANY DISTRIBUTOR UNDER THIS AGREEMENT WILL NOT BE
LIABLE TO YOU FOR ACTUAL, DIRECT, INDIRECT, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE OR
INCIDENTAL DAMAGES EVEN IF YOU GIVE NOTICE OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH
DAMAGE.

1.F.3.  LIMITED RIGHT OF REPLACEMENT OR REFUND - If you discover a
defect in this electronic work within 90 days of receiving it, you can
receive a refund of the money (if any) you paid for it by sending a
written explanation to the person you received the work from.  If you
received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium with
your written explanation.  The person or entity that provided you with
the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in lieu of a
refund.  If you received the work electronically, the person or entity
providing it to you may choose to give you a second opportunity to
receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund.  If the second copy
is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing without further
opportunities to fix the problem.

1.F.4.  Except for the limited right of replacement or refund set forth
in paragraph 1.F.3, this work is provided to you 'AS-IS' WITH NO OTHER
WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO
WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTIBILITY OR FITNESS FOR ANY PURPOSE.

1.F.5.  Some states do not allow disclaimers of certain implied
warranties or the exclusion or limitation of certain types of damages.
If any disclaimer or limitation set forth in this agreement violates the
law of the state applicable to this agreement, the agreement shall be
interpreted to make the maximum disclaimer or limitation permitted by
the applicable state law.  The invalidity or unenforceability of any
provision of this agreement shall not void the remaining provisions.

1.F.6.  INDEMNITY - You agree to indemnify and hold the Foundation, the
trademark owner, any agent or employee of the Foundation, anyone
providing copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in accordance
with this agreement, and any volunteers associated with the production,
promotion and distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works,
harmless from all liability, costs and expenses, including legal fees,
that arise directly or indirectly from any of the following which you do
or cause to occur: (a) distribution of this or any Project Gutenberg-tm
work, (b) alteration, modification, or additions or deletions to any
Project Gutenberg-tm work, and (c) any Defect you cause.


Section  2.  Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of computers
including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers.  It exists
because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from
people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need, are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come.  In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations.
To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation
and how your efforts and donations can help, see Sections 3 and 4
and the Foundation web page at http://www.pglaf.org.

Section 4.  Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To
SEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any
particular state visit http://pglaf.org

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations.
To donate, please visit: http://pglaf.org/donate


Section 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.

Professor Michael S. Hart is the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm
concept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared
with anyone.  For thirty years, he produced and distributed Project
Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.


Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.
unless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily
keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.


Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:

     http://www.gutenberg.org

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
